<p>“<span class="smcap">Our</span> last year at good old Columbia High, fellows!”</p>

<p>“I just hate to think of it, Lanky!”</p>

<p>“We’ve had some great times during these four
years, for a fact; and college can never take the
place of this school. And what fierce battles we’ve
had on the diamond and gridiron with our rivals of
Clifford and Bellport! I’ll be mighty sorry to leave
the old school behind.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps you miss your guess about me, boys.
I may stick to Columbia for another year.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! expect us to believe that kind of talk,
Frank Allen; when everybody knows you’re bound
to graduate with the highest honors ever given at
Columbia High?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span>“Listen, then; and while we hold up here to get
a breathing spell on our practice cross country run.
I’ll tell you how it is.”</p>

<p>“Wish you would, Frank,” said the tall, thin lad,
who was known as Lanky Wallace; though it was
said that at home they called him Clarence. “Here’s
our chum, Bones Shadduck, staring at you as if he
reckoned he was up against the great Chinese puzzle.
Open up and tell us!”</p>

<p>The three boys were in running costume, and had
been swinging steadily along country roads, and
across fields and farms, within five miles of the town
of Columbia, for an hour or more. They were, with
others, engaged in a cross country run; but as it
was only intended to be a “bracer” for great events
in the near future, these three contestants, all of
whom had splendid records in past school races,
had for company’s sake kept close together.</p>

<p>Columbia lay upon the bank of the Harrapin
river, upon which stream the boys found great enjoyment,
winter and summer. Not many miles below
was Bellport, more of a manufacturing town; while
Clifford lay up the river, and on the other bank.</p>

<p>As both of these enterprising towns had high
schools, it was only natural that the pupils should
feel a certain amount of rivalry in their various
sports. And as a rule these were entered upon with
that fine spirit of fairness that adds zest to any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
game where the competition is keen, and victory
cheered to the echo.</p>

<p>In the first volume of this series, “The Boys of
Columbia High; Or, The All Around Rivals of the
School,” the reader is given an account of the school
life of many of the characters; together with some
of the indoor sports suitable to the season.</p>

<p>In the spring it was natural that baseball should
be the leading topic in their minds; and some of the
thrilling battles which they had with the neighboring
teams of Clifford and Bellport will be found in
the book, “The Boys of Columbia High on the Diamond;
Or, Winning Out by Pluck.”</p>

<p>With the coming of summer and hot weather,
baseball was almost forgotten; but a new source of
amusement, as well as competition, arose, when an
eight-oared shell came for the boys of Columbia
High. Of course, not to be outdone, the rival
schools must also embark in the same line. So
a tournament was arranged on the Harrapin by
some of the enterprising citizens of the three towns,
who believed in giving their boys all the healthy
outdoor sport they could. Many of the remarkable
happenings that accompanied that summer carnival
on the water you will find in the third volume, called
“The Boys of Columbia High on the River; Or, The
Boat Race Plot that Failed.”</p>

<p>Another school term found the rivals of the Harrapin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
just as eager to try conclusions with each
other as ever. And as the tang of frost was in the
air, naturally they could think of nothing but football.
And so again they met and fought it out to a
finish for the prize. An account of the fiercely contested
games, where brawn and sinew were often outwitted
by a little gray matter in the brain of a clever
dodger, is given in “The Boys of Columbia High on
the Gridiron; Or, The Struggle for the Silver Cup.”</p>

<p>Then came winter, with a sheet of ice covering
the Northern river, and scores of boys were fairly
wild to spend every spare hour upon it. They had
glorious times that year along the Harrapin, as you
will admit after finishing the fifth volume of the
series, just preceding this story, and which bears
the name of “The Boys of Columbia High on the
Ice; Or, Out for the Hockey Championship.”</p>

<p>And now, with spring at hand, the talk was all of
the great athletic event of the year, which had been
arranged as a fitting wind-up of the finest class
Columbia had ever turned out at a graduation time.</p>

<p>It was to be an open competition, and the pupils
of Clifford and Bellport had received a special
invitation to enter for the various field and track
events on the long program.</p>

<p>Every fine day, when school was not in session,
boys in running costume could be met, jogging
steadily along the country roads. In the fields<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
where the schools played all their outdoor games,
groups of students were to be seen engaged in practicing
putting the shot, high jumping, wrestling,
sprinting short distances, each and every one filled
with the spirit of the hour.</p>

<p>Indeed, Columbia was bubbling over with excitement,
since the great day was now close at hand
when all these tests to prove superiority were to be
brought about before a record-breaking throng.</p>

<p>Columbia, in the past, had been very fortunate in
downing her river rivals; but the boys of Clifford
and Bellport were possessed of the true grit animating
all lovers of clean sport, and they always came
up smiling for a new test. Forgetting the bitterness
of previous defeats, they were ever ready to affirm
their belief in their ability to wrest the prize from
the athletes of Columbia.</p>

<p>And as there had come many rumors of astonishing
progress being made by these rival schools,
many in Columbia went about with sober faces; and
even hinted that they feared it was going to be a
bad year for the famous school.</p>

<p>Frank Allen always bore a leading part in all
these athletic doings; as did his particular chum,
Lanky. And they were out on this Saturday, with
another well-known long-distance runner, Bones
Shadduck, to get their muscles in good trim for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
the grind of the Marathon that was to be the crowning
event of the great meet so soon to come about.</p>

<p>They were the hope of Columbia High. No other
boys ventured to compete with these long-distance
runners when they took a notion to do their best. On
this occasion they were not thinking of trying to
break records, but meant to cover the ground, so as
to become familiar with all its features.</p>

<p>The course had been plainly mapped out, and in
several places the runners were allowed to exercise
their discretion about choosing between several
methods of arriving at one of the many stations
where they were to be registered. That is, if a lad
thought he could make better time by crossing the
country between two roads, he was given that privilege;
though warned that he might get bogged,
held up by a marshy stretch of ground, or even lost
in the big woods, if not fully familiar with the
district.</p>

<p>Consequently it was not likely that anyone would
take advantage of this choice, but all of them were
apt to stick to the main roads, where the going was
good.</p>

<p>Seeing that his two fellow runners were growing
quite curious about the explanation of his assertion,
Frank laughed good-naturedly, and remarked:</p>

<p>“Well, just wait till I wash the dust down my
throat with a good drink at this spring here, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
then I’ll tell you what I meant by saying I might
stick to Columbia High another year.”</p>

<p>“Well, I want to say right now,” remarked Bones
Shadduck, as he sucked at a long scratch on his
hand, which he had received from a hanging vine in
the brush they had just broken through, “that this
thing of cutting across country to save a little time
doesn’t strike me favorably. In the race I wager
I keep close to the roads, and let others take chances
of getting mired, or lost, if they want to.”</p>

<p>Three minutes later, having refreshed themselves
at the cool gurgling spring, the trio of high-school
boys stood for a minute or two before starting off
again on their jogging run in the direction of the
next road.</p>

<p>“Now, Frank, keep your promise,” warned Bones.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll be badgered if I can get head or tail of
what he means,” Lanky Wallace declared, shaking
his head in a way he had when in doubt.</p>

<p>“My folks seem to have an idea that they’d rather
I was a year older before I went to college,” Frank
began.</p>

<p>“Why, that’s funny, but I’ve been hearing a lot
along the same line myself at home,” broke in
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Ditto here,” affirmed Bones Shadduck.</p>

<p>“And so they had me talk with Professor Tyson
Parke about it,” Frank continued; “and he said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
that he could arrange a post-graduate course that
would take up the better part of the year, and put
me in fine fettle for going into the freshman class at
college.”</p>

<p>“Great scheme!” exclaimed Bones, “and just you
see if I don’t put it up to my people at home.”</p>

<p>“Count on me to do the same,” remarked Lanky,
enthusiastically. “Why, it would sort of break the
school ties piecemeal, you see; and, besides, when
you take a post-graduate course, you only go for an
hour or so a day. That gives a fellow loads of time
to take exercise outdoors. And I need a heap of
that, believe me.”</p>

<p>“What do you say about starting on again?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“How far do you think it is to that road?” Bones
queried, sucking again at his bleeding hand, so that
he might extract the last atom of poison that had
come from the scratch of the creeper.</p>

<p>“Oh! about a mile, I reckon,” Frank made answer,
as they began to run.</p>

<p>“Only hope it’s better going than the last one,
then; that was fierce,” Bones went on to say, as he
fell into his regular jogging pace, which the boys
declared he could keep up for an unlimited number
of hours; very much after the style of the Indian
runners from Carlisle School, who got it from their
ancestors, those dusky messengers who would journey<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
hundreds of miles through dense forests, over
mountains and deserts, with little or no rest.</p>

<p>“Looks like we might have a snap here for a
change,” remarked Lanky, as they arrived on the
border of what seemed to be a large pasture, which
told that they were now on some farm where stock
were kept.</p>

<p>So they mounted the rail fence. Frank remembered
noticing at the time that this was built especially
strong, and seemed to be even higher than
usual; but then, as his mind was upon other subjects,
he paid little attention to the fact.</p>

<p>They had about half crossed the field when Lanky
suddenly came to a stop.</p>

<p>“Go on, fellows!” he called out; “I’ve got to tie
my shoe again; I’ll catch up with you in a jiffy,
before you get to the fence yonder.”</p>

<p>“Put a knot in that shoelace, Lanky,” said Bones,
laughingly, over his shoulder; “that makes the
fourth time you’ve dropped down to tie it. Try
that game in the race and it might lose you your
chance. It often hangs on a small thing; doesn’t it,
Frank?”</p>

<p>Receiving no reply to his question Bones glanced
up at the face of his chum. He found that Frank,
while running steadily on, seemed to be apparently
listening intently, for his head was cocked to one
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>“What did you hear, Frank; the halloo of some
other runner who’s bogged over in that swamp?”
demanded Bones.</p>

<p>“No; I thought I heard a snort, and it made me
think of cattle,” replied Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, that wouldn’t surprise me a whit,” declared
the other, immediately; “for I’ve seen signs of
’em all along, and I reckon this field is used for—oh!
now I heard it, too, Frank! A snort, you said;
well, I guess it was more than that. I’d call it a
bellow, and an ugly one at that. There’s something
moving over back of Lanky. I guess he sees it, for
he’s on his feet now, looking. Wow, there comes a
cow, streaking it out from those bushes, and heading
straight for Lanky!”</p>

<p>“A cow!” ejaculated Frank; “that’s a bull, Bones,
and the worst-looking one I ever remember seeing!
We must be at the Hobson farm, and that’s the
fierce old bull Jack was telling me about. He’ll get
Lanky if our chum doesn’t do some tall sprinting
right soon. Run, Lanky, run for all you’re worth!
Make for that tree near the fence, and if he gets
too close, climb up.”</p>

<p>Neither Frank nor Bones dared stand still, for
the bull was heading in their direction, even while
chasing the tall boy from Columbia High. And just
then there were some “lively doings” in that pasture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>HELD BY THE ENEMY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Talking</span> was out of the question just then.
Every fellow was making his legs go about as rapidly
as he knew how; with the bull charging down
after them at full speed, his long tail flying in the
air, while he at the same time emitted sundry half-muffled
bellows that added wings to the flight of the
cross country runners.</p>

<p>Speaking about the experience later on Bones
Shadduck vowed that he broke all known records in
covering the distance that separated himself and
Frank from the friendly rail fence.</p>

<p>They sprang for the top of this as though they
felt the hot breath of the angry bull. Then, feeling
safe for the first time, and with their hearts beating
like trip-hammers, the two boys turned to see what
had become of their chum.</p>

<p>Lanky had been very much nearer the charging
animal than either of his comrades, and he could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
choose his course. With him the “longest way
around” was not the “quickest way to the fire.”</p>

<p>Perhaps he had heard what Frank called out
about the tree that happened to stand about thirty
feet from the fence. At any rate, when he ran, he
was heading directly for that point.</p>

<p>The bull charged at Lanky. It may have been
simply because the tall runner happened to be the
nearest moving object. Then again, Lanky had on
a sleeveless running shirt upon which, back and
front, was a big number seven in glowing red; for
he had been known by that sign in the last match in
which he took part. And, somehow or other, all
bulls, and even some cows, seem to have a deep-seated
hatred for that color.</p>

<p>Lanky ran as perhaps he never did before when
on the home stretch, and with a rival pressing
him hard at his elbow. He had a good reason
for making record time. The prize was safety and a
whole body. If he fell down those cruel-looking
black horns of the bull, even though they had gilt
balls at their ends, would be hooked under him to
give him a toss in the air; after which the infuriated
animal would gore and trample him.</p>

</figure>


<p>But Lanky knew he could not reach that fence in
time to mount. The bull was able to cover ground
even faster than the prize sprinter of the school.
He might jump to one side at the critical moment—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
practiced bull-fighter would doubtless have done
this with ease; but then Lanky was a greenhorn
when it came to such things. In fact, he could not
remember ever having been chased by such an
animal before.</p>

<p>The tree loomed before him. A few more desperate
jumps and he would be able to dodge around
it and escape the first mad rush of his enemy.</p>

<p>Frank was holding his breath. He could not remember
suffering more mental agony than when
sitting upon that fence watching his chum strive
with every muscle in his bony frame to reach the
tree ahead of the charging beast. And all because
he and Bones were so utterly helpless to assist
Lanky.</p>

<p>“Hurrah! he done it!” yelped Bones, with an utter
disregard for grammar that might have shocked
his teacher at school; but the boy was so excited
that he hardly knew what he was saying.</p>

<p>Lanky, with a grand rally at the end, had actually
managed to slide behind the big trunk of the tree.
The bull went galloping past, unable to immediately
bring his forward progress to a stop.</p>

<p>They saw Lanky roll over once or twice, and
again Frank gave a gasp, fearing that the other
might have received some injury in that fall calculated
to prevent him from doing what he must to
escape the next charge of the bull.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>“There, he’s up again, and making for the tree!”
snapped Bones, who could not repress his feelings
for an instant.</p>

<p>“Climb up, if you can, Lanky!” shouted Frank;
but enough time was not given for this performance,
since again the bull was on the move.</p>

<p>Around and around the tree they went, the agile
boy eluding each wild attempt on the part of his
bovine enemy to get him. Again and again those
horns would come against the trunk of the tree with
a wicked crash; it seemed as if the animal was
growing more and more furious as the seconds
sped by without success attending his efforts.</p>

<p>All at once Bones gave a whoop.</p>

<p>“There he goes, Frank! Bully boy, Lanky; you
fooled him that time, all right!”</p>

<p>The one who was in peril had made a quick upward
leap, seized hold of a lower limb, which doubtless
he had been looking at closely with a view to
using it; and bringing into play some of his marvelous
agility as a climber, he threw his lithe figure
up until he could sit astride of the new perch.</p>

<p>But his enemy had by now become aware of what
he was doing. The bull had been bellowing in an
ugly way, and tossing the earth with his horns; and
it was while this performance was going on that
Lanky had taken advantage of the attention of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
animal being turned away from him to make his
upward leap.</p>

<p>Although the bull charged and even tried to reach
his dangling legs, Lanky was able to draw them up
in such a way that he felt safe.</p>

<p>Then Frank, for the first time, laughed. Since
Lanky had managed to get beyond the reach of the
black beast, and seemed uninjured after his close
call, the humorous side of the adventure struck the
other boys.</p>

<p>“Now will you be good, Lanky?” jeered Bones.
“He’s got you nailed there in that tree good and
fast. What word shall we take to your folks at
home? Want to send ’em any message? Expect to
get your meals by aeroplane or kite? He’s going to
camp right there till you oblige him by coming down,
believe me, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“Cut that chaff out, Bones, and be thinking up
some scheme to coax the old sinner away!” called
back the beleaguered one, who had climbed higher
in the tree and could see his chums plainly as they
sat upon the fence nearby.</p>

<p>“Huh! I suppose now you’d like me to step over
there and call him away; wouldn’t you, Lanky?”
demanded Bones. “But all the same I’m not goin’
to do it. There’s only one way you can get out of
that tree.”</p>

<p>“Then tell me,” cried Lanky, eagerly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>“Grow some wings and fly!” answered Bones,
with a loud laugh.</p>

<p>Frank saw that the situation, while not desperate,
had its unpleasant features. He knew something
about the persistency of bulls in general. He had
heard of one that kept a farmer in a tree all night,
and a good part of the next day, nibbling the grass
whenever he got hungry, and always guarding the
tree so that there was no chance whatever for
escape. And the man might have died from weakness
had not a neighbor happened to hear his shouts
and shot the bull.</p>

<p>Lanky must be saved in some way or other, but
just how to go about it was the question. At first
Frank thought he might coax the bull by dropping
over the fence at some distant part of the field. He
tried it, but with no success whatever. The cunning
bull declined to nibble at the bait. It was just as if
he had decided that a boy in the tree was worth two
in the field keeping close to the fence so that it could
be scaled.</p>

<p>“It’s no go, Frank!” called out Bones, after the
other had ventured as near to the animal as he
deemed safe, without drawing his attention a particle.
“You’ll have to try another dodge; or else Lanky’s
going to stay in that tree till Christmas rolls around,
or the Glorious Fourth.”</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, think up some way of getting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
him off, Frank!” called out the impatient prisoner
of the lone tree.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a scheme!” cried Bones.</p>

<p>“Yes, you have!” Lanky answered in some derision;
for he failed to have any great amount of
faith in anything Bones Shadduck originated.</p>

<p>“Well, this one’s a corker, I tell you,” the boy on
the fence went on, eagerly.</p>

<p>“All right, let’s hear it, and speak low so the bull
won’t get on,” Lanky suggested, with mock respect.</p>

<p>“Besides it’ll give Frank and me a heap of fun
watching you, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“Oh! it will, hey? Lots of fun, you say? I’ve
no doubt you’re enjoying this game right well,
Bones; but you’d laugh out of the other side of your
mouth if it was you sitting up here, and me on the
fence. But go on, tell us about it now.”</p>

<p>“Why, you want to watch your chance,” began
Bones, soberly.</p>

<p>“Oh! do I? Chance for what?” demanded Lanky,
derisively, for he seemed to feel that the other was
only having sport with him.</p>

<p>“To catch the bull off his guard, when you might
drop plump on his back. But if you do, Lanky,”
Bones went on hurriedly, and with much apparent
concern, “be sure you get a good hold, because he’s
apt to jump and kick like a bucking bronco, and if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
he knocks you off it’s good-bye for yours. You’ll
be a back number.”</p>

<p>Even Lanky was seen to grin at this wild proposition.</p>

<p>“Well, you are the punk thing, Bones, when it
comes to helping a chum out of a hole,” he called
out. “Frank, I know I can depend on you to hatch
up some smart little trick to shake off this old buffalo
that’s got me up a tree.”</p>

<p>“I’ve tried my best to coax him away, Lanky,”
said Frank, starting to walk off; “but he won’t
budge an inch, and it’s no use.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, Frank; sure now, you wouldn’t be for
leaving me here in this fix, would you, and me that’s
stood by you through thick and thin many a time?
If I had to perch up here long my bones’d be too
sore for me to enter any race for a month of Sundays.
Where are you going, Frank?”</p>

<p>“To hunt up the farmhouse, and see if I can’t get
Mr. Hobson to come to the rescue. I’ll be back before
a great while,” was what Frank called out.</p>

<p>“Bless you for a true chum, Frank, I knew you
wouldn’t leave me in the lurch; and here’s hoping
that you find the farmer at home all right, or his
man. Oh! laugh all you want to, Bones, but it isn’t
so funny when you’re the frog that gets hit by the
stones. Just you try it once and see.”</p>

<p>Time passed slowly to the beleaguered runner.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
He even complained of feeling a little cold, and
talked to Bones about supper as though he began to
fear that, after all, he would have to camp there
in that tree the whole night.</p>

<p>“If you have to stay there, and it comes to the
worst,” Bones had assured him; “mebbe now I
might be able to throw a package of grub to you
from the top of the fence here. I’m the boss
thrower, you know, Lanky. Many a time I’ve got a
runner at the home plate by lifting a fly I caught
away out when I was playing left field for Ben
Allison.”</p>

<p>“There comes Frank now,” the prisoner of the
tree exclaimed, he having a greater range of vision
than the boy who sat astride of the rail fence.</p>

<p>“Got the farmer trailing along, I hope?” ventured
Bones.</p>

<p>“Well, if he has, I don’t see him yet,” replied the
other dejectedly. “Reckon I’m just a-goin’ to sit
here all night.”</p>

<p>“I can get a squint at Frank now, Lanky; and,
say, what’s he got in his hand?”</p>

<p>“Looks like a clothesline to me, Bones,” replied
the other, without much enthusiasm in his voice.
“I thought Frank was smarter than that. If he
thinks he’s going to lasso this big bull with that rope
and hold him even one minute he’s sure got another
guess coming to him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>“Now, you leave all that to Frank,” advised the
other. “You’ve been goin’ with him long enough
to know that he’s smart about getting up schemes;
yes, and carryin’ ’em out, too. Wait and see what
he says, Lanky, before you decide about eatin’ your
supper on a limb.”</p>

<p>Frank came hurrying along and just as Lanky
had said, he was carrying what seemed to be a coiled
clothesline, for the rope was certainly made of cotton
and seemed rather thin at that.</p>

<p>“Where’s Farmer Hobson, Frank?” asked the boy
on the limb.</p>

<p>“Gone with a load of stuff to Columbia, and won’t
be home till late to-night,” came the reply, as
Frank arrived opposite the spot where the determined
bull kept watch and ward over his prize.</p>

<p>“And hasn’t he got a man?” wailed Lanky, as
though he began to feel that everything was conspiring
against him.</p>

<p>Frank went on calmly undoing the rope foot by
foot, and testing it.</p>

<p>“Yes; but he’s sick on his back with lumbago,
and couldn’t hobble out here; so I told him not to
try, and that I’d find some way to get you out, all
right.”</p>

<p>“I’m surprised at you, Frank,” ventured Lanky,
wishing for information.</p>

<p>“In what way?” asked the other, coolly, once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
more starting to loop up the rope, as though getting
ready to throw it.</p>

<p>“Why, even if you manage to get that rope over
his horns it won’t hold a minute. Look at his broad
chest and heavy shoulders, would you? Why, that
bull could snap such a little rope five times over.”</p>

<p>“I reckon he could, Lanky,” Frank went on,
laughing; “but you see, I don’t expect to use it on
him as a lasso. Fact is, I mean it for you!”</p>

<p>“What’s that; goin’ to get it over my neck, and
yank me out of this tree! I sure like that kind of
talk. It shows a kind heart; but my neck is
stretched as long as it can go; so you’ll have to think
up some other dodge, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Listen,” said Frank, seriously. “If I throw this
loop to you, or get Bones here to try it, do you think
you could grab hold of it?”</p>

<p>“Try me!” said Lanky, laconically.</p>

<p>“Well, when you get the end, go as far as you can
in your tree, and tie the doubled rope there. Afterwards
I’m going to fasten the other end to this tree
we’ve got on <i>our</i> side of the fence. Understand
now what I mean, Lanky? You’ve got to do the
tight-rope act; and come out of there by the aerial
route, with Mr. Bull prancing under your heels, but
unable to reach you. How do you like the scheme?”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER III<br>

<small>THE GYPSY CARAVAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">It’s</span> a screamer!” exclaimed Lanky, immediately.</p>

<p>“What I call a peach!” ejaculated Bones Shadduck.
“Say, what was I tellin’ you, Lanky; didn’t I
say our Frank would get up a plan that was goin’ to
beat anything you ever heard tell of? Oh! hurry
up, and let’s get things started.”</p>

<p>“Well, suppose then you take this doubled rope,
which I’ve coiled up, and see if you can land the
end in the branches of Lanky’s tree.”</p>

<p>“And as near me as you can, Bones, remember,”
advised the one most interested; “because he’s just
a-listenin’ as if he knew what we were talkin’ about;
and, if he gets half a chance, I reckon he’ll take that
same rope and wrap it all around those gold-tipped
horns of his.”</p>

<p>So Bones, after finding how he could stand on the
top of the rail fence in a fairly steady fashion, took<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
a survey of the situation, and decided just what
amount of effort it would require to send the end of
the doubled rope into the tree.</p>

<p>He started to wind up by whirling the coils
around his head, after the fashion of a cowboy about
to make a cast. Then, as Lanky, becoming impatient,
begged him to make haste, Bones let fly.</p>

<p>His first attempt proved a failure, for the rope fell
short. The bull seemed so curious about all these
actions that he came over to look at the rope, which
Bones was now dragging back in haste.</p>

<p>“Keep off there, you!” he called to the animal;
“just go back and mind your own business, which I
take it right now is to watch Lanky yonder,” and, as
though understanding what was said, sure enough,
the heavy-set animal turned immediately, trotting
back under the tree, and looking up longingly at the
imprisoned boy, while emitting a low bellow.</p>

<p>“Is that the best you can do, Bones?” demanded
Lanky, wishing to spur the other on; “if it is, better
let Frank take a turn, because I know he can make a
longer throw than that was.”</p>

<p>“You wait,” answered the aroused Bones; “I can
do better than that. Just thought I ought to make a
try throw first. This time I’ll put a little more
steam in it, and you get ready to grab, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“Right here, Bones, put her in my mitt!” called
the other, holding out his hands as though he might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
be a catcher behind the rubber, calling to his slabmate
how to toss them in.</p>

<p>Frank steadied Bones from below, so that he
could feel on firmer footing. And this time the
rope, flying far out, and uncoiling as it went, struck
in among the lower branches of the tree.</p>

<p>“Catch hold, Lanky, quick!” cried the thrower of
the lasso.</p>

<p>Lanky almost tumbled out of the tree in his eagerness
to reach the rope; but fortunately it had caught
on a branch, and he was able to get his hands on it.</p>

<p>“Now climb up, and pass it along,” called Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes,” added Bones, “there’s a hunky-dory place
up yonder to tie it to, after you’ve doubled it like
Frank said. That’s it, Lanky; put the rope around
there, you know.”</p>

<p>Lanky understood and fastened the knotted end
of the line to the upper branch of the tree—an
especially strong one it was, too.</p>

<p>Afterwards Frank climbed the second tree beyond
the rail fence; and as Lanky had tied his end of the
doubled clothesline to an upper limb, Frank did the
same.</p>

<p>There now stretched a taut doubled line, with a
downward slant, from the tree under which the bull
waited patiently for his prey to drop.</p>

<p>“Looks good to me!” announced Bones, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
changed his position on the fence so as to get a
better view of the coming “stunt” of the thin chum.</p>

<p>“Course it does,” grumbled Lanky, as he prepared
to trust himself to the slender line. “Think I’m a
featherweight, do you, just because I’m thin; but
bones weigh a heap, just you remember. What if
she breaks, Frank?”</p>

<p>“It will hold you, all right, Lanky,” replied the
other, confidently; “I tested the single line with my
weight and it stood firm. Now that we’ve made it
double, honestly, I believe it would hold even Buster
Billings.”</p>

<p>As the boy mentioned was considered the fattest
scholar, without exception, in any one of the three
high schools, such positive information should have
gone far toward giving Lanky confidence.</p>

<p>“All right, here I come, then. Phew! I hope the
blooming old thing doesn’t give enough to let me
down so he can poke his horns into me.”</p>

<p>That was really the only thing that Frank feared
in the least. It was with more or less concern,
therefore, that he saw Lanky get in readiness to
start sliding along the rope. As this had a pretty
good slant from the lone tree’s upper branches, he
need not do any climbing, but just work his way
along, and remember to hold on with a firm grip,
no matter what happened.</p>

<p>“Wow! there he comes!” exclaimed Bones Shadduck,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
as the thin boy let go his hold above, and
launched himself upon his aerial passage.</p>

<p>It was a strange sight indeed, with Lanky moving
slowly but steadily down that doubled rope, and the
prancing bull keeping directly underneath him, giving
vent to all sorts of queer noises as he even reared
up on his short hind legs and tried to reach Lanky’s
long, dangling figure with his horns.</p>

<p>“Thank goodness, the rope holds!” cried Bones,
who had been rather doubtful of its strength all
along.</p>

<p>“And it doesn’t seem to sag so very much,” added
Frank, mentally figuring how close bull and boy
might come before Lanky found shelter across the
line of fence. “It’s going to be a close shave, I’m
afraid, though, Lanky; can’t you pull up your legs
some; he might get you when you’re near the
fence?”</p>

<p>“Sure he can,” remarked Bones. “You know
what sort of gymnast Lanky is. Watch him put his
feet in his pockets now.”</p>

<p>Of course, the dangling boy did not go quite that
far, because in the first place he had no such thing as
a pocket in his running togs, and even if he had, he
felt no inclination to carry out the suggestion of
humorous Bones. But he did throw one leg up over
the line, and this took his form just so much further
away from the ugly horns below.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>In this fashion then Lanky passed over the fence,
and was safe. The baffled bull seemed to know that
his intended prey had escaped him. Perhaps he felt
that the boy on the fence must be laughing at him.
At any rate he made a sudden, wicked lunge in the
direction of Bones, and that worthy, being taken by
surprise, might have suffered if he had not allowed
himself to simply fall in a heap on the ground outside
of the rails.</p>

<p>Bang! came the rushing bull against the fence,
which quivered before the onset, and might even
have given way, only that it had been stoutly built
to withstand such rushes.</p>

<p>“Bah! don’t you wish you could?” jeered Bones,
struggling to his feet, his fright a thing of the past;
and he made a face at the bull, that was just two feet
away, although separated by that barrier of stout
rails.</p>

<p>“How are you, Lanky; all right?” asked Frank,
as the long figure of the rescued chum appeared in
sight, dropping down out of the second tree.</p>

<p>“Well, I seem to be all here,” replied the other,
with a broad smile; “but when that old beast was
trying to reach me, I began to think he’d have my
shins scraped, more or less. That was a bully good
thought of yours, Frank. Queerest ride I ever took
in all my life. Talk to me about toboggan slides—why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span> 
they’re not in it with a rope run, and a jumpin’
bull underneath.”</p>

<p>“Who’ll get the rope, Frank?” asked Bones.</p>

<p>“You can, if you feel like it,” replied the other,
with a smile.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, but it’d have to be something more’n
an old clothesline that would tempt me to go into
that field again,” Bones declared.</p>

<p>“Well,” Frank went on, “fortunately there’s no
need of anyone going right now, because I told the
farmer’s wife what I meant to do to get Lanky out
of there, and she said to leave the rope where it was.
Her husband would get it later on, after the bull was
in the barn for the night.”</p>

<p>“Let me have five minutes’ rest after that little
slide, Frank,” entreated Lanky, “and then I’ll be
ready to join you both in another run across to the
road. It must have been the strain that told on me.
Right now my heart is beating like fun.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” assented Bones; “mine is, too, because
I thought that black beast was going to get me
when he ducked my way with a whoop. Say, ain’t
he just the limit now, fellows? Old Hobson’ll get
in trouble with that critter some fine day. He ought
not to keep such a wicked animal around.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well,” Frank remarked, “you know we
really had no business going through his pasture.
Even if you got hurt, your father couldn’t have recovered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
damages if Hobson chose to take it to the
courts. When you trespass, you lose your rights up
to a certain extent. How about it now, Lanky, feel
like you could stand a grilling run again?”</p>

<p>“I’m as right as ever, Frank; and now that the
whole thing’s over I’m ready to laugh at it as hard
as the next one. It sure was the queerest thing that
ever happened to me. A dog had me treed once—a
bulldog that guarded an apple tree belonging to
our next-door neighbor. Our apples were good, you
know, but his seemed to be just the right kind I was
lookin’ for.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Bones.</p>

<p>“Why, the neighbor came along and called the
dog off,” Lanky replied, with one of his customary
shrugs; “me to the woodshed as soon as my dad
heard about it, and—well, what’s the use saying
anything more? I never like to think of that same
interview, give you my word, fellows.”</p>

<p>They had by now started off again. Lanky
seemed to show no signs of having suffered because
of the strain he had just gone through. These
thin, wiry boys are able to stand a tremendous lot of
knocking about, without feeling any bad effects.
Had it been Buster Billings, now, who was a prisoner
in that tree, they could never have effected his
release in the way Lanky was saved. His weight
would have caused any line to sag, so that the poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
fellow would have been an easy mark for the butting
horns of the bull.</p>

<p>After leaving the farm of Mr. Hobson behind the
runners found that they would have to pass over
some more dubious ground. Frank realized that unless
some better course was found than this it would
be the height of folly for a runner to think he could
save time by leaving the firm road, and taking to the
cross country. And being a good, square sportsman
he determined to do all he could to warn the
Clifford and Bellport fellows against any such attempt.
Still, they had the same privilege of examining
the ground that the Columbia High boys did,
and if it struck one of them that he cared to take
chances that was really his own affair.</p>

<p>“There’s the road, fellows!” said Frank, after
they had ploughed through a lot of soft ground, and
were thoroughly disgusted with it all.</p>

<p>“Oh! happy day!” sang Lanky. “When you hear
of me trying to take a short-cut on that same Marathon
race, just engage a room for me at the insane
asylum; won’t you?”</p>

<p>“But looky there, what under the sun have we
got now, boys?” called out Bones, who happened
just then to be a little in the lead of the runners.</p>

<p>“Wagons, hey?” exclaimed Lanky; “and all the
colors of the rainbow at that. Jupiter whiz! did
you ever see such a gay crowd? Say, Frank, these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
must be the gypsies that hang around Budd’s
Corners every other summer; don’t you think so?”</p>

<p>“Just what they are,” came the reply; “but there’s
twice as many this year as ever before.”</p>

<p>“And would you see the fine wagons they’ve got
along?” remarked Bones, as they stood upon the
lower fence rail to watch the caravan pass. “Most
of ’em are fitted up, they tell me, like the cabin of a
boat, with sleeping bunks and a cooking range. I’d
just like to say that one of those wagons must be
worth a heap of money. How do they make it all,
Frank, do you think?” and he lowered his voice,
for the head of the procession was now very close
by, and the boy did not wholly like the looks of the
swarthy men who drove those wagons along toward
the first of the line.</p>

<p>“They do a lot of horse trading,” Frank replied;
“and are mighty smart at it, too. The ordinary
farmer has little chance against a gypsy in a trade;
though he may think he’s some pumpkins, as they
say. Those horses are a pretty good lot, let me
tell you, fellows,” as the wagons began to pass by.</p>

<p>There must have been at least ten of them, all
told, mostly new ones, with all the comforts known
to modern wagon travelers. The boys watched the
procession pass with considerable interest, and from
the way the gypsies stared at them they excited almost
as much curiosity, on account of their running<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
clothes, as the gypsies did in them. And it was
while they stood in this way that Lanky suddenly
began to show a strange excitement, turning toward
his chums with a puzzled look on his face.</p>

<p>“Say, perhaps you fellows didn’t see that little
girl trying to attract our attention in one of those
vans?” he remarked, with more or less eagerness.
“The old gypsy woman pulled her down in a big
hurry, but, Frank—Bones, I sure believe that she
was holding out her baby hands to us, like she
wanted to ask us to help her!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>A MYSTERY OF THE WAGON</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> other two boys looked at Lanky curiously,
as if to see whether he could be in earnest, or only
joking. Lanky was inclined, at times, to show an
odd streak of humor, as Frank had long since found
out.</p>

<p>But the long-legged chap certainly looked serious
enough just then. His eyes followed the line of
gypsy vans eagerly. If there was anything that appealed
to Lanky Wallace it was a bit of mystery,
and he had been known to bother his head for days
and weeks over some trifling affair that the ordinary
schoolboy would dismiss from his mind with
a laugh.</p>

<p>“I tell you she did just what I said, fellows,” he
persisted in saying; “held out her hands to me; and
if ever there was a look of fear on a little girl’s face,
I saw it on hers!”</p>

<p>“Oh, rats!” exploded practical Bones; “you’ve
been reading some silly stuff about gypsies taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the children of rich people and holding ’em for a
ransom. That might have happened years ago, or
perhaps in Old England; but if you think it could
to-day, and in America, why, you’re away off your
base, Lanky. Reckon you ought to have been born
about the year sixteen hundred and seven, instead of
in this age.”</p>

<p>Frank, while doubting whether there could be
anything in what seemed to be a far-fetched idea
of the tall chum, was not so much inclined to “josh”
him as Bones had been.</p>

<p>He and Lanky had known of a case where the
haunting face of a young tramp had kept both of
them guessing for a long spell, and the persistence
of the tall chum had in the end brought the truth
to light. And through that same dogged perseverance
a long-lost son and brother was restored to
his family; while Lanky had made a good friend
in rosy-cheeked Dora, the pretty sister of Will
Baxter.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Lanky,” he said, now, in as serious a
tone as he could command, “was the child fair-haired,
or a brunette; because, you know, all gypsies
are dark?”</p>

<p>Lanky made a wry face, but stood to his guns.</p>

<p>“Sure, she did have a dark little phiz, Frank, that’s
right; but, then, I reckon it’s the easiest thing in the
world to change the skin, and dye the hair. Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
haven’t you had your hands turn brown with the
juice of fresh walnuts every fall, when we laid in
our winter stock, and hulled ’em? ’Course you have,
and so has Bones here. I tell you, fellows, I’ll never
get that look out of my head. If I wake up in the
night, bet you a cookey I’ll think of it right away.”</p>

<p>Frank knew the obstinacy of his chum only too
well. There never was a boy who would persist
more in a thing than Lanky Wallace, though when
he had the truth absolutely shown to him he would
give up, and admit that he was wrong. Some people
who did not fancy Lanky called him pig-headed and
stubborn, but those who were better able to judge understood
the difference between stubbornness and
firmness.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, “if that’s the way you feel
about it, Lanky, there’s only one thing to be done.
To satisfy yourself, you ought to see the child again.
When you find out that she is only a little brown
gypsy, sure enough, you’ll sleep easy again.”</p>

<p>At that Lanky smiled.</p>

<p>“I don’t know whether you’re just kidding or not,
Frank,” he said; “but I’d just made up my mind to
do that same, right now—follow the caravan, and
try to get another glance at that face.”</p>

<p>“Well, you do rush things to beat the band!”
ejaculated Bones. “We came out on this run to see
how the cut-off might be, and to get a point on what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
we could do over the course; but seems to me running
has been about the last on the list with the lot
of us to-day. There was that adventure with the
bull; and now here’s Lanky gone daffy over the
brown face of a baby girl, that just happened to look
sad at him after getting a spanking from her ma!
Frank, do we go with him, or head off for ourselves
right here?”</p>

<p>“Oh, suit yourselves, fellows!” said Lanky,
quickly, for he was very touchy, and ready to resent
anything like a favor grudgingly bestowed. “Just
leave me alone and I’ll show up later.”</p>

<p>Frank, however, realized that somehow his chum
was worked up over the matter more than he could
remember having seen him for a long time. Perhaps
it was the fact that his nerves had been shaken
during his recent affair with the bull. Then again,
there might be a slight possibility that Lanky was
right with regard to the child.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right, Lanky!” he remarked, soothingly.
“I’m going where you lead, and if Bones
objects he knows what he can do. Not that I take
much stock in your kidnapping idea, because such
things happen only once in a long time nowadays.”</p>

<p>“But you admit, Frank, that it could be; don’t
you?” demanded the other, not at all shaken in his
belief.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>“Well, yes, there might be about one chance in
a hundred, Lanky,” Frank replied.</p>

<p>“And I’m taking the hundredth chance,” said the
other, doggedly, as he started off after the gypsy
caravan, which had vanished entirely from view
around a bend in the road while the three runners
were holding this short conversation among themselves.</p>

<p>They sighted it again as soon as they had turned
the curve in the road. As if by mutual consent
Frank and Bones had fallen back, and allowed
Lanky to have the post of honor in the van.</p>

<p>“If she does it again, Lanky,” remarked Bones,
jeeringly, “just you give us the high sign; when
we’ll jump in, and clear up the whole gypsy tribe,
rescue the kidnapped princess, carry her home in
triumph and receive a cool million or so from her
happy dad, as a reward for our heroic achievement!”</p>

<p>“Oh! splash!” was all Lanky sent back over his
shoulder, as he ran steadily on at that telling jog-trot
that seemed never to tire the runner.</p>

<p>They rapidly overtook the caravan, for the horses
were not trying to make any speed, having come a
long distance, it might be, since sun-up; and, besides,
the drivers knew they were within a few miles
of the place where, once in so often, they made camp
for several days, or a week at a time.</p>

<p>Lanky paid no attention to the rear wagons, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
passed alongside and kept pushing on. He had eyes
only for the most gorgeous van in the whole procession;
since it had been at the side window of this
he had seen the face that, somehow, appealed to his
sensitive heart.</p>

<p>The door at the rear of the high wagon was almost
wholly closed, Lanky noticed as he came along,
though once he really thought he saw a face, surrounded
by coils of black hair, in the opening,
which could only belong to a gypsy woman.</p>

<p>He kept his eyes fastened on the side window,
for he knew that his two skeptical chums were waiting
for a sign and would be apt to decide one way
or another, depending on what was to be seen. And,
sure enough, a face did appear there, that of a
child in the bargain, and a girl, too. But she simply
stared at the odd costumes of the three boy runners,
and seemed to hold them in the scorn a true gypsy
child feels for the house-dweller.</p>

<p>Lanky was grievously disappointed. It seemed
that he had been mistaken after all, and, always
willing to “take his medicine,” as he called it, he
prepared to accept the expected chaffing of Bones in
a good spirit. Had that ended the matter, doubtless
Lanky would have put it out of his mind for good
and all, but as it happened there was a little sequel,
and it is often upon these trifles that great events
depend.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>The three boys had passed the gorgeous van, and
were pursuing their way along toward the leading
wagon, when a sound came to their ears that was
rather significant under the circumstances.</p>

<p>It was certainly very like the cry of a frightened
child, quickly suppressed, and yet coming from the
identical van toward which Lanky had drawn the
attention of his chums.</p>

<p>All of them turned their heads to look, but only
to meet the surly frown of the dusky gypsy who
drove the pair of fine horses attached to the wagon,
which, from its appearance, might shelter the queen
of the roving tribe.</p>

<p>Frank knew that for Lanky to make any attempt
to interfere with the gypsies at such a time would be
the height of folly.</p>

<p>“Go on; don’t stop, Lanky!” he exclaimed, ready
to push the other onward if he manifested a stubborn
disposition, as though inclined to investigate.</p>

<p>“But, didn’t you hear it?” demanded the tall fellow,
irresolutely.</p>

<p>“Move along there!” said Bones, as if in disgust;
“why, whatever’s coming over our bold Lanky Wallace,
when even the squalling of a gypsy kid gets on
his nerves?”</p>

<p>“Go on, Lanky,” said Frank, in earnest tones;
“you’ll only make trouble, and get in a fight, if you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
try anything here. Wait a while, and perhaps you
can find out all you want without having a row.”</p>

<p>Realizing that Frank was right, as he generally
was, Lanky again started on; but after passing the
head of the gypsy caravan he slackened his pace
enough to let his chum come alongside.</p>

<p>“You heard that, too; didn’t you, Frank?” he
asked, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Of course I did, and so did Bones, because you
know he spoke of a gypsy kid crying,” returned
Frank, himself more than a little puzzled by now.</p>

<p>“It wasn’t the one at the window, because she was
older, and besides, you saw her stare at us,” Lanky
continued, in his old argumentative way. “No, sir;
that one who started to scream was a smaller child,
and must have been the same I saw before. Didn’t I
say she held out her baby hands to me? And now,
when she begins to cry, that old gypsy crone shuts
her off quick. Frank, honest Injun now, I wouldn’t
be surprised if she just took her by the throat and
choked her to keep her still!”</p>

<p>“Oh, come, now, Lanky, you’re letting that wild
imagination of yours just run away with you!” remarked
Frank; but the other noticed that there was
a serious expression on the face of his chum at the
same time.</p>

<p>“You more’n half believe it yourself, Frank Allen,
and you don’t dare deny it!” he exclaimed, heatedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>“Tell me about that, will you?” Bones could be
heard saying to himself, as he ran along just behind
them, and evidently “listening for all he was worth,”
as Lanky remarked later on; for despite his skepticism
Bones was himself beginning to feel a little
touch of the fever that was working on Lanky.</p>

<p>“Only this far,” Frank went on to say, in response
to the accusation of his chum; “there might be
something in what you’ve got on your brain. But
the chances are ten to one, Lanky, that in the end
it’ll prove to be only a little gypsy girl who has been
bad and spanked by her ma.”</p>

<p>“Oh, now it’s only ten to one; is it?” demanded
the other, quickly; “and a little while back the odds
were a hundred to one. Shows that you’re falling
to my idea pretty rapid, Frank. Now, I’ve been in
gypsy camps heaps of times and so have both of
you. Will you promise to give me a straight answer,
if I ask you a question?”</p>

<p>“You know I will, Lanky,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“If it’s nothing personal, I’ll promise, too,” came
from the cautious Bones, who may have had a few
secrets of his own to which he did not wish to
confess.</p>

<p>“Did you ever hear a gypsy child cry, either one
of you?” demanded Lanky, with a triumphant look
on his thin face, as though he felt that this question
was what he would call a “clincher.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>Frank paused a brief time as if for reflection.</p>

<p>“I never did!” he finally replied, with emphasis.</p>

<p>“How about you, Bones?” pursued Lanky.</p>

<p>“Oh, well, I don’t remember about it,” replied the
other; “but then, what does that prove? I reckon
they do yell when they get a lickin’, just the same
as other kids; only we never happened to be there
when the old lady’s slipper was getting in its work.”</p>

<p>But Frank saw the point Lanky was making, and
appreciated it, too.</p>

<p>“I’ve been told,” the tall boy went on to say, “that
gypsies bring up their children about like the old
Injuns used to do. They learn when little kids never
to show what they feel. Never heard of a red Injun
boy weepin’; did you, Bones? Well, I guess nobody
ever did; and gypsies, they’re about in the same
class.”</p>

<p>“Well, and even if that’s right, Lanky, how do we
know but what the old queen was givin’ the baby its
lesson in keepin’ from cryin’? Sure, somethin’ shut
the noise off right quick, I acknowledge that. But
you just can’t make me believe in any silly yarn like
a stolen child, and such stuff. Bah! next thing
you’ll be lookin’ for a strawberry mark on my left
arm, and tryin’ to make out I was changed in the
cradle.”</p>

<p>But Lanky would not take any notice of these
slurs. Frank could see that he was deeply impressed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
with the idea that the little dark-faced girl
at the window of the big van had actually appealed
to him for help in her childish way. And, knowing
Lanky as he did, Frank felt positive that this would
not be the last of the affair.</p>

<p>“He’ll go to their camp and make trouble sooner
or later,” Frank was saying to himself, as the three
runners neared the outskirts of Columbia; “and I
suppose it’s up to me to stick to a chum through
thick and thin. Perhaps he’ll be cured if only he
can see the kid and talk with the mother. However,
I’ve got to back Lanky up, no matter what
wild scheme he may hatch in that brain of his. Because
he’s a good fellow, and one of the best chums
I’ve ever had.”</p>

<p>And so the run over the course of the Marathon
race that was to be a leading feature of the athletic
meet had been productive of several thrilling incidents
that would not soon be forgotten by the three
lads who were chiefly concerned.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>ON THE CAMPUS GREEN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Come</span>, brace up, Lanky; ’tisn’t time for your
funeral yet!”</p>

<p>“Why, we haven’t even had the preliminary trial
races yet to see who’s going to be chosen to represent
Columbia High in the big athletic meet, and
here’s one of our best Marathon boys getting cold
feet!”</p>

<p>A group of lads stood around on the campus during
recess, shortly before noon, comparing notes
about the chances their school would have when
up against the crack athletes of Clifford and Bellport.</p>

<p>Buster Billings had been the first speaker, the fat
boy who has often figured in these stories of Columbia
High, while the second one who was trying
to cheer Lanky up, boy-fashion, by giving him a
“dig,” was Jack Comfort, reckoned the best all-round
shot-putter the school had ever known.</p>

<p>In the group were several others who have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
familiar figures in the past. The good-looking boy
who took no part in the conversation, seeming to
be very quiet, was Ralph Langworthy. Once he had
been known as Ralph West; and Frank Allen had
been instrumental in solving a great mystery that
hung over his head, thus finding his own true
mother for the new chum.</p>

<p>Then there were Paul Bird, a very close chum of
Frank’s; Bones Shadduck, Tom Budd, a boy who
could never keep still, but must be turning hand-springs,
or standing on his head, half of the time;
Jack Eastwick, the great doubter of the school, who
should have been named Thomas, everybody declared;
“Jonsey,” who once upon a time gave out in
a boat race, and put Columbia in a hole; and last of
all “Red” Huggins, whose faculty for getting his
tongue twisted when excited often resulted in queer
expressions.</p>

<p>Lanky Wallace had been unusually grave all
morning, and the boys noticed it, too. Of course,
none of them knew what was ailing the tall student,
for Frank alone was in the secret. And most of the
talk they were flinging at Lanky now was done for
the evident purpose of “getting a rise” from him. If
he could be stirred up to give them some heated
back talk they might find out what ailed him.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, some of them were feeling a little
uneasy. Columbia would evidently have need of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
her reserve stock of talent this spring in order to
come out ahead in the various trials of skill with her
bitter rivals. And Lanky was reckoned one of the
shining lights in many a contest where agility and
power of endurance counted.</p>

<p>“Cold feet, nothing!” the tall boy flung back at
Jack Comfort. “When that happens you’ll find the
moon made of green cheese, boys. Fact is, I’m just
a little bothered to-day about somethin’ that’s got
nothin’ to do with the athletic meet.”</p>

<p>“Been eating some grub that’s given you indigestion,
p’raps?” suggested Jonsey.</p>

<p>“For goodness sake, Lanky, don’t get out of trim
now; we need you the worst way, if we expect to
wipe up the ground with those up and down-river
fellows,” implored Paul Bird.</p>

<p>“That’s just what,” broke in Bones Shadduck;
“ever since Lanky got treed by that bull he’s been
in the dumps. For once he ran up against somethin’
he couldn’t beat, and it’s made him sore.”</p>

<p>The boys laughed, for they had all heard the story
to the last particular.</p>

<p>“Well, all I know,” remarked Buster Billings,
pathetically; “is that Clifford is just boiling over
with confidence. I was up there last night to a little
spread, and you never heard such talk in your life.
Why, they feel dead sure they’re going to walk all
over us this time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>“Will they?” observed Jack Eastwick, in his customary
sarcastic way, which had long ago become a
settled habit with him; “maybe, maybe not. We’ve
got some pretty husky specimens right here in old
Columbia, and when the time comes we expect to
pull down a few of those plums ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Bully for you, Jack!” cried Buster, patting the
speaker encouragingly.</p>

<p>“I reckon I know what ails Lanky!” ventured
Jonsey, who had a little bone to pick with the other,
and lost no opportunity to give him a sly poke.</p>

<p>“Then tell us, or we’ll ride you on a rail!” threatened
Jack Comfort.</p>

<p>“Dare I, Lanky?” asked Jonsey, not wanting to
go too far.</p>

<p>“Sure. Just tell everything you know, or think,
Jonsey. It won’t take long,” was the answering
shot that came back.</p>

<p>“Well, the fact of the matter is, Lanky’s best girl’s
gone back on him, because I saw her out riding with
that new city fellow that came to Columbia a few
months ago. He’s as fine a looker as you ever saw,
the girls think, and pretty, rose-cheeked Dora Baxter
seems to just take to Mr. Walter Ackerman.”</p>

<p>Jonsey had kept one eye out for an avenue of
escape in case Lanky made a dive in his direction;
he also counted on the others to hold the tall boy
back, so as to give him a chance to escape; for he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
never could do it by simply running. But contrary
to his expectations, Lanky made no offensive move.
On the other hand, he even laughed in a strained
way.</p>

<p>“That’s where you’re away off, Jonsey,” Lanky
declared. “It’s a matter of mighty small difference
to me whether Dora Baxter chooses to keep company
with Walter Ackerman or not, because we’ve
had a spat, and don’t speak when we pass by. And
I want to ask you all right now, please keep her
name out of any conversation you may happen to
have about me after this.”</p>

<p>When Lanky spoke in that way they knew he
meant it, and there was not one in all that group of
his schoolmates who would venture to offend him
by declining to regard his request.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Buster Billings, as if ready to give
the puzzle up, “if none of the things we have mentioned
is what’s ailing you, Lanky, for goodness
sake, whatever it is, get it out of your system as
quick as you can. You’re not the same kind of
fellow we’re used to seein’ around. When you show
up you give us all a cold shiver. Honest, now, it
makes me think of spooks, graveyards and all that
stuff just to look at you, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“Oh! does it?” jeered the other; “if that’s the
case I’ll get a move on and step over to my chum,
Frank Allen, who’s just come out of the classroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
yonder. But before I go, fellows, just make your
minds easy about me. If I am feeling sort of down
in the mouth and serious-like just now, it isn’t going
to affect my athletic stunts one little bit. I’m as fit
as ever I was to run the race of my life. Frank
knows, and he’ll tell you that same thing.”</p>

<p>“Are you?” said the doubter, Jack Eastwick;
“maybe, maybe not. Time alone will tell that. Saturday
the preliminary trials come off, and then we’ll
get a pointer on what all our boys can do.”</p>

<p>But Lanky did not stop to listen to the “croaker.”
Jack often threw cold water on everything with
which he had any connection. It was very discouraging,
to be sure, and more than once his
schoolmates had threatened to hold him under the
pump if he didn’t quit harping in that disagreeable
way. For a little while Jack would manage to reform,
only to break out later on; for habits are
deep seated.</p>

<p>Apparently Lanky was more than eager to see
Frank, judging from the way he hurried over to the
other, as he issued from the school, stopping to
speak to the old janitor, who was known among the
boys as “Soggy.”</p>

<p>“Hello, Lanky!” was Frank’s greeting, as he eyed
the other curiously; “seems to me I haven’t run
across you this whole day up to now. But then I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
came late, as I had an errand to do for the professor,
you see.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it just happened that I wanted to get in
touch with you, too,” remarked the tall boy, as he
thrust his arm through Frank’s and started him
walking so as to leave the janitor behind.</p>

<p>“Soggy was telling me that some of the boys had
started to playing practical jokes on him again,”
Frank remarked. “He’s got a notion that it must
be that Bill Klemm and his cronies, Watkins Kline
and Asa Barnes.”</p>

<p>“They’re sure a bad lot,” commented Lanky,
drily. “Ever since Lef Sellers was hustled off to
military school by his dad because he made such a
racket in town that the authorities threatened to
send him to the reform school, Bill has tried to fill
his shoes as the town bully, and bad boy generally.”</p>

<p>“And some say he’s even worse than Lef ever
was,” added Frank; “but see here, Lanky, what’s
up?”</p>

<p>“Now please tell me why you think anything is?”
demanded the other.</p>

<p>“Well,” Frank went on, with a good-natured
laugh, “I can see it in your face that you’ve got
something to tell me. You may fool some of the
fellows, but you can’t me, old chum. Open up and
let’s hear what it is. Anything connected with the
big meet we’re all talking so much about?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>“Nope,” replied Lanky, tersely.</p>

<p>“I hope you haven’t been running across the trail
of that Walter Ackerman, and doing what you once
threatened to do, Lanky?”</p>

<p>The other sneered at this.</p>

<p>“Don’t see any scratches or bruises on my phiz;
do you, Frank?” he remarked; “and as I calculate
that Walter is something of a scrapper himself, I
couldn’t polish him off without showing the signs;
could I? Shucks! forget him, won’t you? If Dora
chooses that city chap before me, she’s at liberty to
do it. I’m not going a foot out of my way to please
her and make her think she’s the only one in Columbia
worth looking at. There are plenty of girls.”</p>

<p>But however brave his words, Lanky did not deceive
the keen eyes of Frank Allen, who happened
to know what a tremendous hold the red-cheeked
Dora had upon the affections of the tall boy.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s change the subject, Lanky,” he said.
“You didn’t deny it when I remarked that <i>something</i>
was exciting you. What is it? Anything
that concerns me?”</p>

<p>“That’s just according to whether you mean to
keep your word, and join me in my little look
through that gypsy camp this afternoon or to-morrow
morning,” was the quick response of the other.</p>

<p>“Oh that’s what ails you; is it?” exclaimed
Frank, stopping to look once more into the eager<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
face of his chum. “Why this new outburst? Have
you heard anything more about that little girl you
<i>thought</i> called to you, and held her hands out as if
she wanted you to take her away from a cruel
prison?”</p>

<p>“Now you’re taking your turn at having a little
fun with me, Frank,” said Lanky, in an aggrieved
tone. “But you just wait a bit. No, I haven’t heard
a single word, one way or the other, about any girl
in the gypsy camp. But, by a funny accident, I
<i>have</i> learned about a child who was lost a month or
so ago over in a Pennsylvania city; and, Frank, it
was a little girl, too!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>MAKING PLANS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> looked queerly at his companion as Lanky
said this.</p>

<p>“But, say, didn’t I hear you make a remark a
minute or so ago that there were plenty of girls?” he
said; at which the other chuckled.</p>

<p>“That’s what you did, Frank; but then this is
a different thing,” he replied.</p>

<p>“Oh! is that so, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Because, you see, Bones laughed at the idea
of such a thing happening in these times—as a child
bein’ stolen. And when I ran across that story in an
old paper over at our house, I cut it out, just to
show you that every little while something like this
does happen.”</p>

<p>“Have you got it along with you?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>“Sure I have, and I want you to read it,” with
which Lanky produced a long slip of paper, about
three columns of newspaper matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>Frank let his eye run along it hastily; but he had
a faculty for gleaning all the points of a story almost
at a glance. Some of the boys declared that Frank
Allen would make a great reporter; but then there
were many other positions in life in which he could
make his mark, if half they said of him were true.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s an interesting story, I see,” he remarked;
“and I hope that the poor mother, Mrs.
Elverson, has found her little Effie long ago. For I
notice that this is cut from a paper that’s two
months and more old, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Frank,” the other answered,
promptly.</p>

<p>“This account tells of how the nurse took the
little girl out walking and never turned up again,”
Frank went on to say.</p>

<p>“Just what it does, Frank, and I know what
you’ve got on your mind.”</p>

<p>“They traced her to the train, and she set out for
another city not far away, where the detectives lost
the trail; and although a week had gone by when
this account was printed, not a single thing had
they learned. The nurse had disappeared just as if
the ground had opened and swallowed her up, this
reporter says.”</p>

<p>“His words, just like you say, Frank,” admitted
Lanky, nodding his head encouragingly.</p>

<p>“But, Lanky, from start to finish of this story<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
there isn’t a single mention of gypsies,” Frank
continued.</p>

<p>“Huh, not a peep, sure’s you’re born, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Then what makes you bring it to me to read, just
as if you felt dead sure this little dark-faced child
in the gypsy van might be the golden-haired Effie
Elverson?”</p>

<p>“Now, hold on, Frank,” interrupted the other,
with a sudden change of front. “You know I
didn’t say a word about that. Fact is, I explained
in the start I only fetched this paper for you
to see that what Bones said isn’t true. Right in
these up-to-date times children <i>do</i> disappear once in
a while. Yes, and I wouldn’t put it past a gypsy
tribe to steal a little girl, and even dye her hair!
Laugh, if you want to, Frank.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not laughing, Lanky,” replied the
other. “To tell the honest truth, somehow you’ve
gone and got me worked up more than a little about
this business. And since I promised to help you
out, if I could, I’ll go along when you visit that
gypsy camp. But we must lay our plans first.”</p>

<p>“How’s that?” demanded Lanky, eagerly; for
when it came to mapping out a campaign he was
always willing to yield the palm to his wide-awake
chum.</p>

<p>“If you go to nosing around that camp without
some good reason, I’m afraid you’ll get in a peck of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
trouble right away,” Frank went on, quietly.
“Those gypsies are a hot-blooded crowd, and they
don’t like being spied on. And it would be all the
worse if it happened that there was any truth in
what you suspect, and the queen kept a stolen child
inside her big painted van.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right there, Frank. What had we
better do?” Lanky asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking that part of it over, and struck
an idea that might pan out all right,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“I’d wager it was a good one before you said a
word; but put me wise, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Why,” Frank began, “I remembered that the
gypsies always made their camp at Budd’s Corners
every year; and I hear they’ve settled down for a
week’s stay this time at the old place. So I went
over to see Mr. Budd.”</p>

<p>“Yes?” Lanky observed, in what he meant to be
an encouraging tone.</p>

<p>“I told him all about it, Lanky; and, although he
laughed at your idea, he was willing enough to
make me a messenger, to do some business with the
head of the tribe, who, you must know, is the old
queen herself!”</p>

<p>“Say, you do beat anything I ever saw for getting
down to business,” declared Lanky, proudly. “Why,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
that’ll just give us the chance of our lives to see
what’s inside that big van of hers; won’t it?”</p>

<p>“It would, if she invites us in,” replied Frank;
“you see, she might act suspicious. Perhaps she
even noticed what you did when we passed the caravan
Saturday. You turned your head, and stared
straight at that particular van. I saw the driver
look sour at you, just like he wanted to tell you to
mind your own business. As to getting a look-in;
as Jack Eastwick would say, ‘maybe, maybe not.’”</p>

<p>“But no matter,” persisted the determined Lanky,
“even if we don’t get an invite to come in, you can
be talking to the old lady to beat the band, while I
just meander around the camp, and see what’s
doing. Mebbe I might even run across the little
girl somewhere. Just give me a chance to say ten
words to her, and it’ll settle the business whether
she’s bein’ kept there against her will.”</p>

<p>“Well, when shall we go—to-night, or in the
morning early before school?” Frank went on to ask.</p>

<p>“I’ll see you after we get out this afternoon, and
we can settle it then,” replied the tall boy, after reflection.
“You see, seems to me the night time isn’t
the best for what I want. She’s only a little mite of
a girl, and chances are she’d be asleep by then. I’d
rather take the mornin’, when she’d be wide-awake.”</p>

<p>“That’s where you show a wise head,” commented
Frank, as they turned once more toward the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
schoolhouse at the other end of the campus, where
scores of boys and girls were gathered in groups,
or walking back and forth, laughing, talking and
altogether making merry.</p>

<p>Frank pretended not to notice, but he saw Lanky
suddenly stiffen up, and turn his head toward a certain
point where a rather handsome, though proud-looking,
young fellow was sauntering with a very
pretty girl, who had just come to high school that
year.</p>

<p>Of course this latter was the fickle Dora, about
whom so much had been said, and who was surely
pretty enough to turn the head of even a plain,
sensible fellow like Lanky Wallace. And the boy
could be no other than the “city fellow,” Walter
Ackerman, toward whom half the maids in Columbia
were friendly disposed, since he certainly was
the best-looking boy in town.</p>

<p>Just then was heard a great shouting from the
basement and a crowd of boys came trooping forth,
laughing uproariously.</p>

<p>“There’s Bill Klemm and his bunch, with a few
decent fellows in the bargain,” remarked Frank.
“Soggy is having a fierce time with them right now.
He threatens to complain to Professor Tyson Parke
if they keep going on as they are; and you know,
when good, old Soggy says that, he must be pretty<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
well rattled, because he does hate to see the boys
punished.”</p>

<p>“There he comes out, Frank, and he looks as mad
as a wet hen,” remarked Lanky, glad to have his
attention turned from the sight of Dora walking
with the good-looking newcomer in Columbia; perhaps
Lanky may have begun to fear that it had been
partly his fault that unlucky quarrel had come about;
but he would never admit it now, since she had
taken to teasing him by openly encouraging the
attentions of a fellow he was jealous about.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be surprised if that Bill Klemm had
been smoking again in the basement,” Frank suggested.
“You know it’s against the rules; but little
he cares for that. Some fine day they’ll be setting
the school afire.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” went on Lanky, “and then good-bye to Bill
Klemm, just the same as we got rid of Lef Sellers.
It’ll have to be a skip-out for Bill, though, because
his folks haven’t got the cash to send him to a military
academy to get the training he needs.”</p>

<p>“Here comes Minnie Cuthbert and my sister,
Helen; and they look like they wanted to speak to
us, Lanky,” remarked Frank.</p>

<p>Two very attractive girls hurried up. One was
Frank’s only sister, of whom his chums, Ralph Langworthy
and Paul Bird, were both very fond. The
other was a lively girl, whom Frank himself had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
taken to all the class dances, singing schools, as well
as church choir meetings, for a long time.</p>

<p>The deposed town bully, Lef Sellers, had once
hoped to be Minnie Cuthbert’s first choice, and the
fact that Frank had stepped in between had been
the main cause of his enmity toward our hero.</p>

<p>“It isn’t true; is it, Lanky?” demanded Minnie,
as they came up. “He didn’t throw you over a
tree, and then pound you with his hoofs as you lay
on the ground?”</p>

<p>“Whatever are you talking about?” demanded
Frank; but at the same time he smiled and thus
betrayed his knowledge.</p>

<p>“Why, some of the boys have been telling us the
greatest stories you ever heard, all about that terrible
beast Farmer Hobson has out at his place.
They say he chased Lanky around a tree in the
pasture, and with his horns just tossed him—well,
one said the tree was forty feet over, but Jack Eastwick
modified it and called it thirty. But even that
is a high jump for anyone to make!”</p>

<p>At that Frank exploded with laughter, and even
Lanky grinned.</p>

<p>“Say, aren’t they the limit, now, giving the girls
all that taffy?” the latter remarked. “I did meet
with the farmer’s bull, Minnie, and he chased me
around a tree, all right, because I couldn’t sprint as
well as Frank and Bones, being too far from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
fence at the time. So I climbed that tree. And in
the end they got a rope to me, which I fastened to
a high limb, and went hand over hand, till I was
over the fence and out. And now they all say I’ve
got to enter the athletic meet as the champion tight-rope
walker, and performer on the high trapeze.”</p>

<p>Just then the bell rang for school to begin, and
laughing at Lanky’s good-natured description of
his wonderful adventure, the girls set out on a run
toward the entrance of the fine building of which
Columbia people were so proud.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>THE BENEFITS OF DISCIPLINE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Fire</span>!”</p>

<p>The dreadful cry is never heard without a wave
of fear. And in a crowded school it must always
strike terror to the hearts of every child, young and
old. Yet that was what came floating in through
the open windows, as the droning of pupils reciting
ceased for a brief time between classes.</p>

<p>Fortunately, Professor Tyson Parke, the principal
of the high school, had always insisted on the
most rigid fire drill. Nobody ever knew when this
was going to be sprung on them, for the one object
was to make the pupils feel that there need never
be any fear of a holocaust; since ample fire-escape
stairways, iron ones along the outside of the great
building, had been provided.</p>

<p>And so, on this afternoon, after that first spasm
of alarm, some of the more knowing among the
scholars quickly decided that it must be a last fire-drill<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> 
test the principal was giving them, before the
break-up for the summer holidays. Their confidence
ran to others, just as a spark plays along a
train of gunpowder. Some smiled, and even
nodded their heads in a wise fashion, as if to say
they could not be deceived, and that it was only a
mock alarm after all.</p>

<p>The various teachers, as in duty bound, started
their classes toward the fire-escapes which had been
arranged especially for their use. There must be
the utmost order preserved, for that was one of the
rules to be strictly enforced.</p>

<p>But the first boys and girls who came out upon
the iron balconies, and started to descend the stairways,
realized that this time it was not the old cry
of “wolf!” Dense clouds of smoke seemed to be
pouring out of the basement; and Soggy was seen
to be rushing here and there, as though he had lost
his head in the excitement. Returning to the school,
after going on an errand for the principal, he had
discovered that a calamity threatened Columbia, with
a large percentage of her half-grown children boxed
up within those brick walls.</p>

<p>Down each stairway streamed the students. They
had been appalled at first, but some of the teachers,
keeping their heads, had circulated the story that it
must be all a part of the principal’s plan to get them
accustomed to the idea of a fire; and that the smoke,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
as well as Soggy’s wild behavior, was “make-believe.”</p>

<p>This was intended as a means to quiet the excited
students; for the freshman class was the first
to come forth, with the sophomores next; then the
juniors, older and more seasoned; and the seniors
last of all.</p>

<p>By the time Frank’s class issued forth, and began
to hasten down the narrow stairways, the sight was
a thrilling one. Smoke was now coming out of the
basement windows, and the door, in great volume,
showing that the fire must have found a good
draught there among the kindling and coal left over
from the preceding winter.</p>

<p>It was too bad, in one sense, that the seniors had
to come out last; for among the older boys of this
class, to graduate in June of this year, a fire-fighting
organization had been built up. And even now as
they came forth, a number of the lads carried
buckets, while several had strapped on their backs
chemical fire extinguishers; and others held hand
grenades, meant to be hurled into the midst of a
conflagration, which they were supposed to help put
out by the liquid and gases set free by the bursting
of the receptacle.</p>

<p>Frank Allen had been placed in command of this
detachment of fire-fighters; for well did Professor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Parke know the ability of the boy for undertaking
any work of this kind.</p>

<p>When Frank hastened down the iron stairway he
was figuring just how they should go about it in
order to get the better of those fierce flames, which
everyone now knew must be gaining more power
each minute.</p>

<p>Professor Parke was directing the dismissal of
the scholars, who were told to keep at least at the
other end of the campus; for the firemen of Columbia
might be expected to respond speedily to the
alarm bell that was now beginning to sound its thrilling
and brazen notes; and they would want all the
space available in order to work.</p>

<p>Soggy, the janitor, was quite beside himself.
Twice he had acted as though about to dash madly
into the smoke-filled cellar, but was restrained by
some of the teachers.</p>

<p>Frank gave one last look around, in order to make
sure that his little company was at his back. He
saw that some of the boys had white faces, but from
the way they set their teeth together, it was evident
that they meant to stand by him, no matter what
happened. And that fact gave him courage; for had
the boys weakened just then, Frank could have done
nothing alone.</p>

<p>“It’s mostly smoke up to now, fellows!” he cried,
as they drew nearer the entrance to the cellars.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
“And we’ve just <i>got</i> to get in there, and put it out.
Don’t you smell pine wood smouldering? Well, that
shows where the fire is, over in the bin where Soggy
keeps the kindling. We all ought to know every
inch of this cellar, because we’ve played in here
every wet recess. Ready to follow me, now?”</p>

<p>“You bet we are!” called out several; for it only
needs a leader in any crisis, and hosts are ready to
follow.</p>

<p>“Keep in a bunch,” continued Frank, coolly.
“And remember, no one must throw his hand
grenade without orders. Scattered, they won’t do
a bit of good; but sent to the right spot they can
knock out nearly any blaze going. Come along,
fire-fighters! We’ve just got to save good old
Columbia High!”</p>

<p>When the crowd of students, girls and boys, saw
that dozen brave lads boldly enter the cellar from
which that pungent smoke was pouring, they held
their breath with suspense. In fact, just at that
moment, besides the crying of a few hysterical
younger girls, the only sounds that could be heard
were the brazen notes of the town alarm bell, calling
the volunteer firemen to rally at the engine house.</p>

<p>Already people were running wildly toward the
high school.</p>

<p>As soon as Frank, in the van of the boy fire-fighters,
had entered the cellar, he saw that the situation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
was not quite as bad as he had feared. True,
the smoke made their eyes sting, but through it
they could see some tongues of flame beginning to
play fiercely among the waste wood in the great bin.</p>

<p>He headed straight that way. Just as Frank had
said, every boy ought to know the lay of things
down here. Close by was the refreshment room
where Mrs. Louden disposed of certain light
luncheons during recess. Sometimes she went home
immediately after school began again, for she had
much cooking to do. Then again, she would stay
until after school was out at half-past one; to cater
to those students who had not exhausted their funds,
and had a long way to go before reaching home.</p>

<p>On this particular day it happened she had left
early; and that was why no one had discovered the
fire, which must have been smouldering quite some
time before the alarm was given by an outsider,
passing the school.</p>

<p>Frank immediately felt renewed confidence. A
man with a hose just then could have extinguished
the fire without much effort, though it was just getting
a good start. Ten minutes later—yes, even
when five minutes had elapsed—it might have proved
beyond holding, and the building be doomed.</p>

<p>Frank had a fire extinguisher on his back, and
this he instantly set playing upon the blaze. Two
other boys, upon receiving orders from the foreman,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
copied his example; while those who carried hand
grenades, or small liquid-filled receptacles, intended
to put out fires that were just beginning, began to
get in their work.</p>

<p>“Hurrah!” they shrieked, as they saw an immediate
change begin to take place in the character of
the threatening fire; “give it to the old thing, Frank!
Soak it good and plenty, fellows! We’ve got it on
the run! We’ll knock spots out of it, sure as you
live. Hurrah for the Columbia High fire brigade!
Whoop-la! once more now, and all together, boys!”</p>

<p>They certainly did smite that rising blaze right
and left. Such a combination of chemicals as was
poured upon it was enough to discourage almost any
fire.</p>

<p>“We’ve got it on the run, boys!” cried the exultant
Frank, as he saw that, bit by bit, the flames had
begun to jump up less fiercely, and gave positive
signs of giving up the unequal contest altogether.
“Here, who’s that down there? Red Huggins has
fainted with the smoke, fellows! Bones, you and
Paul Bird carry him out! Come back again, if you
can get hold of any water, and bring buckets, so
we can soak this bin from end to end.”</p>

<p>The boy who had succumbed to the smoke, which
he had inhaled, was carried out of the cellar. The
appearance of those who held him by the legs and
head was the signal for a gasp of horror. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
the news was circulated that the fire was under control,
and that Red had only swooned.</p>

<p>Loud cheers began to arise, for everyone was
wildly excited by this time; and it could be noticed
that the teachers were as vociferous as any of the
students.</p>

<p>Buckets of water began to arrive, and were carried
in to the fire-fighters, who dashed them upon
the last spluttering remnant of the blaze, which gave
up with a final hiss.</p>

<p>Leaving some newcomers to continue this treatment,
Frank ordered his band out of the basement.
He knew from his own feelings that they were
almost at a point where they might drop down, just
as Red Huggins had. The smoke smarted their
eyes so that they were nearly blind when they finally
issued forth. And how good that pure air did seem,
as they drew it into their lungs, which had, for
some little time, been filled with smoke-laden
atmosphere!</p>

<p>Around them pressed a dense throng. Parents
had arrived in squads by now; in fact, everyone in
Columbia must be on the way there at least; and
filled with a terrible fear concerning the boys and
girls whom they knew were students under that
single roof.</p>

<p>Cheers were rising in waves, and growing with
each demonstration, led by Professor Parke in person,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
who was very proud of his boys, and would
never forget how they had, in following out his
exact directions for an emergency, saved the building
of Columbia High.</p>

<p>“Here come the fire engine and the ladder wagon,
full tilt!” shouted someone; and then the shouts
broke out afresh; but now they were happy cries.</p>

<p>“It’s all over! Go back home, and put away your
helmets for another day. You’ve lost your job,
boys! Frank Allen and his high-school fire brigade
put it all out! Three cheers for Frank and his
bunch! Everybody yell now.”</p>

<p>It was the loud-voiced cheer captain who shouted
these words; and it seemed as if a thousand people
joined Herman Hooker in the cheers he called for,
that made the ears of Frank Allen and his comrades
burn, even as their eyes had smarted with the
smoke of the fire in the basement of the high school.</p>

<small>LANKY’S PRIDE CONQUERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Parke</span> asked the young fire-fighters
to stay a while, after he had given instructions that
the rest of the students leave for home. As far as
possible he wished to soothe the excited condition
of the crowds that thronged around the building.
And he also wished to personally thank each and
every one of those brave lads who had done such
splendid work in getting the fire under control.</p>

<p>The firemen of the town took matters in hand,
and saw to it that there was not the slightest chance
of a stray spark being left undiscovered, to play
havoc, perhaps at night time.</p>

<p>They also wanted to investigate; for it seemed
very queer how a blaze could originate in the cellar
when no fires were going at the time. Some of the
boys believed they could give a guess; and soon it
was being circulated far and wide that Bill Klemm
and his two cronies had been lighting matches in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
basement at recess that very day, just to provoke old
Soggy.</p>

<p>But they seemed to have made themselves scarce.
When Chief of Police Hogg, dressed in his
resplendent uniform, with a silver star gleaming on
his broad chest, called around at the several homes
of the three suspected ones late that afternoon, to
make inquiries, they were not to be found anywhere.
And before long it was known that Bill, Asa and
Watkins must have run away from home, afraid
that they would be arrested. At any rate, they had
been seen making fast time away, as soon as they
got out of the building, and before it was known
that the school could be saved.</p>

<p>The principal started making inquiries on his own
account, and after hearing what the janitor had to
say, he could easily guess what had caused the fire.
Of course the three boys to blame had not intended
doing anything so terrible as to set fire to the school.
They had broken a strict rule laid down by the head,
however, and must be severely punished, when
found.</p>

<p>“Frank,” said Professor Parke, as he joined the
little group of waiting boys, “and the rest of you,
I hope you will pardon my keeping you here so
long; but I found it difficult to get away from some
of the school directors, who are bent on investigating,
and taking action toward securing the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
punishment of the offenders. And my dear boys,
I could not let you go without taking each one of
you again by the hand and telling you how proud I
am of you all.”</p>

<p>There were really tears in his eyes while he spoke;
and Frank knew that if ever the principal were sincere
in all his life it was just then.</p>

<p>Professor Parke was an almost universal favorite
among the pupils of Columbia High. Out of all
the students but a small fraction found any reason
to dislike the head of the school; and, as a rule, they
were just such characters as Bill Klemm.</p>

<p>“Of course,” continued the head master, with a
twinkle in his eye, “all of you will be distressed, I
know, to learn that we will be unable to hold school
to-morrow, because of the excitement; as well as
the smoky odor that has permeated every classroom
in the building. The directors think it would be too
vivid a reminder of the thrill of to-day; and they
have instructed me to send out word that the building
will not be in use until Wednesday.”</p>

<p>The boys tried hard not to smile, but it was no
use; for when did the promise of an unexpected
holiday bring gloom to the heart of the average,
youth, whether in the primary class, or the senior
grade?</p>

<p>“And by the way, Soggy wishes you to come
down and see him in the basement before you go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
home,” the principal went on, as he dismissed Frank
and his corps of fire-fighters. “He is enthusiastic
over the fact that you mastered the blaze before the
regular department arrived. Why, he says the building
would have gone, only for your prompt work.
After this you can ask Soggy anything, and he’ll
grant it. He’s got you down in his book as heroes,
everyone.”</p>

<p>They found the cellar in a sad mess, for the water
was inches deep on the cement floor, the regulars
meaning to have some fun out of it, after being
“called to the colors” by the alarm bell.</p>

<p>Soggy pounced upon the boys, and went around,
shaking everyone by the hand as though “he thought
he had hold of a pump-handle, and was the early
morning milkman,” Lanky Wallace declared.</p>

<p>“Now that it’s all over, boys,” the pleased janitor
declared, “sure I’m believin’ ’twas worth all it cost
to find out what sort of stuff you young gentlemen
had in you! I’ll never forget it, never! And Columbia
High is still on the map, I’m glad to say, thanks
to you. Nine names I’m going to write down in
my book; and, boys, if Soggy can do anyone of
you a favor, just let him know. He’s willing to
go to the extent of his wages any time.”</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of this,” called Ben Allison.</p>

<p>“Yes, it’s getting too warm again, boys!” cried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
Bones Shadduck; for some of the larger juniors
were classed with the seniors as fire-fighters.</p>

<p>And so they came trooping out of the basement,
laughing heartily. Soggy was a favorite with most
of the boys. There could hardly have been a more
efficient janitor; and yet he bemoaned the fact for
a long time that he had not discovered some trace
of the smouldering blaze before he went on that
errand for the principal, to find the building endangered
on his return.</p>

<p>But if Frank believed that he had run the gauntlet
to its conclusion when he got through with Soggy,
he counted wrongly. Beyond the confines of the
campus a group of the girls waited, eager to greet
the heroes of the occasion, and perhaps secure to
themselves just a little of the glory that was apt to
shine like a halo around the heads of those happy
fire-fighters.</p>

<p>Minnie was there, and Frank smiled to see the
eager look she bent on him as he joined her.</p>

<p>“Oh, Frank! how do you feel?” she asked,
anxiously. “All that horrid smoke you must have
swallowed, I should think would make you sick.
You do look pale right now; and you ought to go
home and lie down.”</p>

<p>“Well, what sort of sissy do you take me for,
Minnie?” asked the amused Frank. “A boy ought
to be used to smoke. Lots of them seem to get a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
lot of pleasure out of soaking themselves in it, when
they go to college, you know. Why, I’m feeling
as fit as ever, I guess; and I expect to go on that
long run this afternoon, just to keep in trim for the
trial heats Saturday next.”</p>

<p>“Of course I’m glad to hear you say that, Frank;
but it did frighten us when we saw you lead the way
into the cellar, with all that black smoke pouring
out.”</p>

<p>“It wasn’t so very black, you know, Minnie,” interrupted
Frank, teasingly.</p>

<p>“Well, anyway,” she went on, “Helen and I just
fell into each other’s arms; and we stood that way,
hugging tight, all the time you were in there. We’re
both proud of you; and Helen would be here to say
the same if she wasn’t so busy telling Paul Bird
something like that right now.”</p>

<p>Lanky Wallace was hovering around, as though
he wanted to speak to Frank; and the latter could
give a pretty good guess what it might be.</p>

<p>“Just wait for me a minute while I speak to
Lanky, Minnie,” he remarked; “and then I’d like to
walk home with you. I’ve got something to say
about that little boat-ride we planned to take to-night,
because the moon is full, and it’s going to be
a glorious night. Can you wait for me a minute
or two, Minnie?”</p>

<p>“I suppose so, seeing that I’ve already waited an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
hour almost; but be as quick as you can, Frank, for
I’m almost famished, I confess to you,” was the
reply; as the girl gave him one of her most roguish
smiles, for which almost any sensible fellow would
feel like going through fire and water, if he could
feel that it was meant as a reward for his daring.</p>

<p>“Say, I didn’t like to call you away,” remarked
Lanky, as Frank joined him. “But I wanted to
say that as we have that run this afternoon, and
there’s going to be no session to-morrow, perhaps
we’d better postpone our trip to Budd’s Corners, till
the morning. How does that suit you, Frank?”</p>

<p>“All right,” replied the other, briskly; “I couldn’t
go to-night anyhow, for Minnie made a date with
me to take her out boat-riding in the full of the
moon. Is that all you wanted to say, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and now return to your pleasant little chat
with Minnie,” the other said, with a long-drawn
sigh that Frank understood very well.</p>

<p>“By the way, Lanky,” he remarked, “seems to
me I saw you talking with Dora just a little while
ago. Have you made up again?”</p>

<p>“Not that I’ve heard about,” replied Lanky,
gloomily. “Of course, I want to treat her civilly, as
a fellow always ought a girl he used to think a heap
of; but I can’t forget how she gave me the cold
shake that night we had the class dance in the barn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
If she’d only ask me to forget that, I’d quit feeling
like thirty cents, and perk up again.”</p>

<p>“But she was talking to you; wasn’t she?” persisted
Frank.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, she said she was glad I got out of
that cellar O. K.; that she was <i>so</i> proud to think
that she and I <i>used</i> to be such very good friends;
and a lot more of the same kind; but not a peep
about bein’ sorry because she cut me that night.
And, Frank, I guess I showed her that I wasn’t
carin’ a cent. I was as cool as you please; and
thanked her just like you might the mayor of Columbia,
if he came to tell you the town fathers had
voted a medal for your work to-day.”</p>

<p>Frank looked at him curiously. He knew the
state of Lanky’s feelings, and that the tall chap
cared more for fickle little Dora than he was
willing to acknowledge. And then and there Frank
determined to enlist the services of Minnie Cuthbert
in trying to heal the breach between the two
estranged ones; though, of course, he would not
think of hinting about this to proud Lanky.</p>

<p>“I guess you must have, Lanky,” he said, shortly;
“because I saw her turn, and walk away with her
head held high in the air. You didn’t notice her
hand when she held it out to you, I suppose?”</p>

<p>“Well,” replied the other, with a flush of what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
might be regret, “you see that smoke it was fierce,
and I’ve been about half blind ever since.”</p>

<p>He turned abruptly and walked away. Perhaps
it may have been the smoke caused his eyes to water
then, for Frank was positive he saw them glisten
with some suspicious moisture.</p>

<p>“The poor old chap does feel it more than he’ll
admit,” he said to himself as he started to rejoin
the impatient Minnie. “But if anybody can fix
things, Minnie will. Takes a girl like her to handle
a delicate subject. She’ll get chummy-like with
Dora, and draw her out. Then she’ll tell her how
bad Lanky feels, and what she ought to do as the
right thing, after cutting him dead that night. Oh!
it’ll be all right soon, I reckon.”</p>

<p>And as Frank walked home with Minnie Cuthbert
they had their heads close together in a way that
made more than one old gossip smile and look wise;
not knowing that they were discussing the carrying-out
of a generous act.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IX<br>

<small>AMONG THE NOMADS OF THE ROAD</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There’s</span> the gypsy camp, all right, Lanky,”
remarked Frank, on the following morning, about
nine, as the two chums sauntered along the road
beyond the confines of the town of Columbia.</p>

<p>They had managed to elude all their friends, in
some way or other; for since Lanky was determined
to settle the question that had been bothering him
ever since first passing the gypsy caravan, it was of
the utmost importance that they enter the camp of
the nomads without a crowd of chums to keep them
company.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Frank,” remarked the other, with
a little laugh; “and just as you said, I was off my
base when I thought they might’ve pulled up stakes,
and cleared out durin’ the night. Of course nobody
knows what’s in my mind, and so they’ve not gone
and got scar’t. Well, we’ll soon see now whether
I’ve been a loon, or if that kid <i>did</i> mean to attract
my attention.”</p>

</figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>“Are you still thinking the same way?” asked
Frank, in a low tone; for they were by this time
approaching the outskirts of the gypsy encampment,
where several gay tents had been erected among the
expensive wagons with the commodious and painted
tops, that were made to serve for both sleeping and
eating places.</p>

<p>“Can’t just get to see it any other way, I tell you,”
Lanky persisted. “I’ve been turning and twisting it
around every which direction, but all the time I just
seem to see that little girl holdin’ out her baby hands
to me. Never did have such a thing grip me, I give
you my word, Frank.”</p>

<p>“All right, then,” replied his chum, resolutely.
“We’ll go through the performance just like we
planned it. I only wanted to make sure you hadn’t
backed water, because it wouldn’t be worth while to
take the chances unless you felt dead sure there
might be something in it.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do just as you said, Frank, and
look like any fellow might when he had a chance to
walk around in a gypsy camp. There’s lots of queer
things to see; and I want to talk with one or two
of those boys, if so be they’ll answer civil questions.
But you can bet I don’t touch on <i>that</i> subject once.
But, Frank, I’ll use my eyes to beat the band; and
if she’s around I’m bound to see her.”</p>

<p>“Well, here we are, close up now; so haul off, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
fight shy of the matter. Let’s jabber away like a
couple of boys would, that had been sent here on an
errand, and wanted to look around, just to see how
these ramblers live when they are in camp.”</p>

<p>Lanky, to use his own expression, “buttoned up
his lips” right then and there. He could not tell
when some member of the gypsy tribe might be
lying behind a bush, and overhear what they were
saying; and it was the part of discretion to keep a
close watch over everything they did from now on.</p>

<p>Suspicious looks greeted their arrival at the camp.
Both men and women, even the younger element
among the nomads, seemed to question the wisdom
of allowing a couple of boys to enter the enclosure
where the belongings of the tribe were scattered
about.</p>

<p>But Frank stepped up to the first man he met, and
there was something so manly about his demeanor
that unconsciously, before he had spoken a word, the
gypsy smiled.</p>

<p>“I want to see the queen, Esther you call her, I
think,” was what Frank said.</p>

<p>“She is not telling fortunes any more,” said the
man. “It has brought us more trouble than dollars,
and so she has stopped. But they were always true;
and sometimes the house-dwellers liked them not on
that account.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>“But I don’t want to see her for that,” Frank
insisted.</p>

<p>“What would you, then, boy?” demanded the man,
a little suspiciously now.</p>

<p>“I have been sent here to see her by the gentleman
who owns this land,” Frank continued, boldly. “The
old agreement has run out, and it was understood
that the next time you came to stay here, your
leader would make a new one. I have brought it
for the queen to sign, after we have talked the
matter over.”</p>

<p>At that the gypsy’s eyes showed more wonder than
ever. Undoubtedly he marveled to see a mere boy
sent on such an important errand. But, at any rate,
Frank’s explanation seemed to have cleared away
the doubts that were beginning to harass his mind.</p>

<p>“If that is so, come with me. I will show you
where the queen can be found,” he said, with more
respect than he had used before.</p>

<p>Frank turned to his companion, and remarked, in
a careless way:</p>

<p>“Just make yourself at home, Lanky, till I get
through. I guess there won’t be any objection to
his hanging around the camp a while; will there?
He wants to understand how gypsies live when on
the road, you see.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right; let him stay as long as he wants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
You come this way with me,” and as he said this
the swarthy-faced, squatty man started off.</p>

<p>Frank was about to follow when he heard Lanky
draw his breath in a curious way, which had been
arranged as a signal between them. And coming
when it did, this told Frank that his chum meant to
say something in a low tone as they stood for a few
seconds, before he himself followed the gypsy.</p>

<p>“I saw something,” muttered Lanky, when their
heads were close together.</p>

<p>“What was it?” asked Frank, quickly.</p>

<p>“Over at the big wagon, where you’re going now,”
the other went on.</p>

<p>“Where the queen lives, you mean?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Well, she must ’a’ just discovered that there were
strangers in the camp, because I saw her chase
<i>something</i> up the steps into the wagon. She hid it
with her dress all the while, so I couldn’t make sure;
but, Frank, I just know, as certain as I’m here, that
it must have been that kid. She don’t want anybody
outside to set eyes on that little girl. Now,
why should she act that way if the child belonged to
her people? I tell you, it looks more and more to
me like there must be fire where you find smoke.”</p>

<p>There was no opportunity to say any more. The
gypsy man had come to a halt, and was waiting for
Frank to overtake him. Perhaps he supposed that
the messenger was warning his companion to be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
careful how he touched anything, and got himself in
a mess with the campers.</p>

<p>Frank was soon face to face with a middle-aged
woman, whose face, though marked by many
wrinkles, had a keen look upon it. Her black eyes
seemed to bore him through. He had seen Queen
Esther on other occasions, for these gypsies came
along about the same time every year, camping in
the pasture at Budd’s Corners, and trading horses
with the farmers for miles around.</p>

<p>If a farmer had a horse that did not please him
he would hold it until these nomads arrived, when
he tried to drive a shrewd bargain with them. But,
though at the time he might flatter himself on
having gotten the best part of the trade, as time
rolled on he would awaken to the fact that after
all he was mistaken. But by then the gypsies were
sure to be far on their way; and a whole year would
elapse before they again made their appearance on
the scene.</p>

<p>Frank quickly introduced the subject that had
brought him there. He believed he saw a sudden
look of relief flash over the strongly marked features
of the queen, as though certain fears had been set
at rest.</p>

<p>She immediately began to discuss the proposition
suggested by Mr. Budd, and with a business-like
manner that proved her right to be at the head of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
the tribe. The owner of the field had entered into
the spirit of Frank’s design; and in order to give
Lanky more time in which to do his prowling, the
negotiations were prolonged by various little hitches
that had to be smoothed away.</p>

<p>So slow was Frank in reaching an agreement,
and getting it properly signed, that half an hour
must have passed since he and Lanky first arrived
at the borders of the gypsy encampment.</p>

<p>And all of this time the tall lad was having a
chance to roam around the camp, observing what
went on, and doubtless picking up points that might
prove of more or less value to him later on.</p>

<p>Frank saw him from time to time, but seemed
to pay not the slightest attention to what he was
doing. And on Lanky’s part it can be said with
truth that he surely gave his chum no trouble whatever.
He sauntered here, and stopped there to watch
some boys playing a game with a pocket-knife very
similar to mumble-the-peg, with which of course
Lanky was familiar.</p>

<p>All this time Frank was somewhat nervous, for
he did not know but what at any minute there
might be a sudden explosion. Lanky was apt to be
impulsive; and if he really found that his suspicions
had good grounds to rest upon, possibly the rash
fellow might try to carry off the little girl. Frank
had warned him, however, against anything so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>
foolish, and gained his solemn promise to let it be
taken in hand by those more capable of engineering
the deal than two boys might seem to be.</p>

<p>But there was no alarm, for which Frank felt
happy. And having finally gained the signature of
Queen Esther to the new contract, though she
grumbled over the rate of renting the pasture for
two weeks each spring, Frank was now ready to
depart from the strange camp.</p>

<p>He too looked around him curiously. Many
unfamiliar scenes greeted his eyes to the right and
to the left. Frank had watched the gypsy queen
while they talked, and he was ready to admit that
she certainly showed signs of nervousness more than
a few times. Again and again would she half turn
her head, and always to glance up at the elevated
door that marked the rear of the big van, near which
they sat on a rustic bench and talked.</p>

<p>To tell the truth, she did seem bothered about
something connected with that same wagon. Frank
had sat down in such a position that he could himself
steal a curious look that way from time to time;
but though the minutes had crept along, he could
not say that he had once seen that closed door move
during the period of his conference with Queen
Esther.</p>

<p>He found Lanky waiting for him near the border
of the camp, examining the gypsy way of making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
a fire, with a big iron pot hanging over the flames
by means of a stout chain, that in turn was fastened
to a heavy iron bar resting in the crotches of two
stakes driven into the ground.</p>

<p>“Makes me think of the old witch scene in ‘Macbeth’
we were reading about the other day, where
they dance around the fire, and say, ‘Boil and
bubble, toil and trouble,’” Frank remarked as,
joined by his chum, they both strode out from among
the wagons, children with dusky faces and staring
black eyes, keen-faced men, and chattering women,
and headed for the road.</p>

<p>“Well, what did you find out?” asked Frank,
when they were beyond sight of the camp.</p>

<p>“I saw her again,” said Lanky, drawing a long
breath as of repressed excitement.</p>

<p>“Did she say anything; or did you have a chance
to ask her what you said you meant to?” was what
Frank fired at his chum.</p>

<p>“Well, no, Frank,” replied Lanky, slowly, but
with triumph in his voice; “you see, the old queen
was so close I was afraid she’d hear me. But I
made motions to let the little girl know I was her
friend, when she poked her head out of that side
window of the wagon; and what d’ye think, she
just dropped this out to me!” and he held up a
small object before the astonished eyes of his chum.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>THE BUNCH FROM BELLPORT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span> looked hastily around him to see that they
were not observed. Then he took the article which
Lanky Wallace was holding out.</p>

<p>“Why, it’s a child’s little bonnet, Lanky!” he
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Glad to see you guess that at the start,” remarked
the excited Lanky, with a touch of humor in his
voice.</p>

<p>“And the little one dropped this down to you;
did she?” pursued Frank, as he again thoughtfully
examined the article of wearing apparel.</p>

<p>“Just what she did, Frank. Never said a single
word, either; just gave me a look I won’t soon forget.
Reckon she’s frightened to death of that old
gypsy queen, and didn’t dare give a little peep. But,
Frank, don’t you see the poor little thing wanted me
to understand something?”</p>

<p>“I think she did, Lanky,” replied the other, a
serious look on his face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>“It’s a child’s bonnet, just like you say, Frank;
but tell me, do you think for a single minute any
gypsy child ever wore such a contraption as that?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t, for a fact, Lanky,” answered Frank,
readily.</p>

<p>“Looks kinder expensive to me, even if it’s badly
soiled right now; eh, Frank?” continued the tall boy.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’re right, it was an expensive bonnet,
Lanky. No poor person could ever afford to buy
such a thing for his little girl. It stands for money.
Now, the question comes, how did that bonnet ever
get into the hands of the little, dark-faced girl in the
queen’s wagon; and what did she want you to understand
by dropping it before you?”</p>

<p>“Frank, honest to goodness now, don’t you see
that it was a regular mute appeal? Here was the
only link that poor little thing had, connecting her
with the happy past, before she fell into the hands
of these rough gypsy rovers. Somehow it must have
seemed to her that if she ever could get back again
to the ones who used to love her that bonnet was
going to do the trick!”</p>

<p>Lanky could hardly contain himself, he was so
excited.</p>

<p>“I wonder now if that could be so?” mused
Frank, still looking at the delicate little article, made
up chiefly of lace and silk, with a faded blue ribbon
fastened to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>He examined it closely as though entertaining a
faint hope that he might discover some clue to the
past. But in spite of his efforts nothing resulted
from his search.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think, Frank?” demanded
the impatient Lanky, after a little time had elapsed,
and he considered that his chum must have made up
his mind.</p>

<p>“Seems to me there’s only one thing you can do,”
came the reply.</p>

<p>“Then tell me,” begged Lanky.</p>

<p>“You’ve got that clipping safe and sound, I
hope?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Sure I have, and right here in my jeans now,”
Lanky replied.</p>

<p>“Let me look over it again,” Frank remarked; and
upon his chum pushing the fragment of newspaper
in his hand, he studied it as he walked on.</p>

<p>“I’m glad of one thing,” he remarked, presently,
when Lanky thought he could not stand the suspense
much longer. “They give the gentleman’s
home address here, which is a lucky thing for us.”</p>

<p>“Chuck that, Frank, and tell me what you mean,”
Lanky pleaded.</p>

<p>“Why, you’ve got to communicate with this Mr.
Elverson right away, and ask him if his little girl,
who was carried away by a crazy or revengeful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
nurse, months ago, wore a little bonnet made of lace
and silk, and decorated with a pale blue ribbon.”</p>

<p>“Wow! all that is going to take a few good
plunks to pay the expense, if you mean I must telegraph
it!” exclaimed Lanky.</p>

<p>“I’ll help you out, if you’re short, and you ought
to know that,” Frank immediately declared; “and
my father would back me to any extent, I’m dead
sure. This begins to look as though there might be
something in it; and if that child is being held there
in that gypsy camp against her will, she must be
taken away from them.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah! that sounds good to me, Frank!” cried
the delighted Lanky, pleased beyond measure to
learn that his cautious chum had finally decided to
come over to his side of the fence.</p>

<p>“And the sooner we go about that part of the
business the better. I’ve got some money with me,
and if we need more I know where to go for it,
Lanky.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” declared the tall lad; “nothing
like striking while the iron is hot, as we used to
learn in our copybooks in school, when we were
kids. Let’s head for the station right now, then,
Frank, and see if we can’t hatch up a message that
ought to give this Mr. Elverson the shock of his
life.”</p>

<p>Ten minutes later two boys, breathing hard from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
fast walking, appeared at the little railroad station
in Columbia, and asked for a bunch of telegraph
blanks.</p>

<p>“My! you must be going to keep me busy the rest
of the morning, boys!” remarked the young fellow
who acted as ticket agent, express representative and
telegraph operator combined.</p>

<p>“Oh! we’ll let you have time to grab a bite of
lunch, Conrad,” replied Lanky, in his humorous
fashion.</p>

<p>It took the boys about half an hour to concoct a
satisfactory message. They wanted to cover all the
ground without wasting words; for money did not
grow on bushes, Lanky remarked, as he cut out
several adjectives that counted for little.</p>

<p>Lanky wanted to sign Frank’s name to the message,
but the other refused to allow it.</p>

<p>“This is your affair, and I’m not going to butt
in,” he declared positively. “And I only hope you
reach the gentleman without delay, so that you may
have a reply soon.”</p>

<p>“What could delay it?” asked Lanky. “Seems to
me that he’ll be just wild to get in touch with us,
if that bonnet is like the one his child wore when
the nurse lit out with her.”</p>

<p>“He might be away from home, you know, and
they would have some trouble in getting him,”
Frank observed, for he knew his chum would be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
bitterly disappointed if he did not hear from Mr.
Elverson right away; why, just as likely as not
Lanky would lie awake half the night, expecting to
hear the telephone bell ring, and the voice of the
night operator at the station calling for him.</p>

<p>They had to look very mysterious when Conrad,
the agent at the station, having read the message,
and counted the words, informed them it would cost
three dollars and a quarter; and then seemed to expect
them to tell him what was in the wind. For
Frank had cautioned his rather talkative chum not
to breathe a word about it to a living soul until they
had heard from the gentleman.</p>

<p>“Now we’ve got the rest of the day before us,”
said Frank, as they left the station, arm in arm;
“what are we going to do with it?”</p>

<p>“It’s about ten, now,” Lanky remarked, “and I
reckon there’ll be quite a squad of our fellows down
at the athletic field, tryin’ every stunt going; because,
you see, lots of ’em believe they can qualify for the
broad jump, the shot-put, the hammer-throw, or
even in the sprints. And you’ll see some of the
queerest athletic work ever if you come down there
right now.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go you, then, Lanky,” agreed Frank. “Besides,
I heard someone say there was going to be
a big bunch from Bellport coming over to watch,
and see what our boys could do. You heard what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
happened in both Clifford and Bellport, didn’t you,
last night?”</p>

<p>“You mean when they got news about the fire
at our school, and that Columbia was going to get
to-day off for a holiday, the trustees of both the
other high schools called meetings, and agreed to
close up shop for to-day, too. Mighty decent of
them, I say, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, what else could they do?” the other went
on to say. “The boys who expect to enter the competition
could claim that Columbia would have a
big advantage in an extra day for practice. Even
now there’s been some lively grumbling among some
of the Bellport crowd, to the effect that we’re favored
in the way things are run.”</p>

<p>“Well, it isn’t so,” declared Lanky, indignantly.
“There never was a fairer arrangement when the
three schools came to meet up with each other. I
kinder had an idea some of those Bellport fellows
were in for making trouble; and it wouldn’t surprise
me a little bit, Frank, if they started their racket
to-day.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hope not,” remarked Frank; “that would
be too bad to have Bellport on the outs with us.
Their athletic captain, Cuthbert Lee, is a square
fellow, if ever one could be. But let’s put on a little
speed, and make for the field.”</p>

<p>About a mile from the border of Columbia lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
the athletic field, that had been given over to the boys
of the town by some gentleman whose heart remained
young, even though his hair had taken on a
silvery tint.</p>

<p>Here a grand-stand had been built, and there were
several houses where those who competed in the
events could dress. There was even a shower-bath,
and numerous other appliances looking to the comfort
of Columbia boys; with a keeper to take charge
of it all, and prevent destruction of property.</p>

<p>Usually the Columbia people went to see the baseball
and football matches on foot, for the distance
was not great. Crowds came from Bellport and
Clifford by way of boats on the river, or, in the case
of the former town, by using the trolley that connected
the two places.</p>

<p>Some of the Columbia fellows who had boats
were wont to use them, any excuse to get on the
water being eagerly seized upon, especially if some
of the girls were of the same mind.</p>

<p>And so, as Frank and Lanky drew near the big
field, they seemed to see young people moving in
all directions, the vast majority of them heading
for the pleasure-ground; since it was known that
many of the boys would be practicing diligently,
taking advantage of this unexpected holiday.</p>

<p>“What did I tell you?” remarked Lanky, in an
aside to his chum, as they discovered a big bunch of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
high-school fellows, with blue bands around their
hats, coming from the direction of the trolley, and
talking boisterously.</p>

<p>“Some of the Bellport fellows, sure enough,”
Frank replied; for he recognized several familiar
faces; and the blue ribbon told the story by itself.</p>

<p>“Yes, and if you tried to pick out the loudest
talkers in all Bellport you’d be apt to find them in
that crowd,” Lanky went on. “Honest Injun, now,
Frank, I wouldn’t be surprised if they had come over
here to-day just to josh our boys, and make trouble.
Why, there might be a fight before the day is done.”</p>

<p>“That would be too bad,” Frank said, looking
serious at the very thought. “We’ve always been
on mighty good terms with Bellport, and for one
I’d hate to see any bad blood between the two schools.
We’ll try and warn our fellows not to pay too much
attention to what they may say. It takes two to
make a quarrel, you know.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>ALMOST A RIOT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> scene was a lively one. Scores of high
school boys, all of them belonging in Columbia, were
working out their various theories for succeeding in
the trials which were scheduled to come off on the
following Saturday. Each fellow seemed to have
his own particular way of trying to excel; and some
of these were really remarkable, affording plenty of
amusement to the good-natured crowd of young
people, boys and girls combined, coming from town
to watch operations.</p>

<p>When Saturday night came around it was expected
that the programme would have been carried
out, and the selections for the grand meet concluded.
The very best in every class would have been chosen;
and after that Columbia could settle down to wait
for the day when the question of supremacy between
the rival schools was once more to be tested in open
and square sport, without fear or favor.</p>

<p>A number of the more stocky boys were engaged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
in putting the shot, and throwing the discus or hammer.
Jack Comfort seemed to be by all odds the
favorite in these events, though there were several
who believed they had a chance.</p>

<p>Even fat Buster Billings was seen in light attire,
and perspiring freely as he hopped around, and
finally sent out the weight with about the grace of
a waddling duck. Once he even fell headlong after
letting go, and rolled like a barrel, to the intense
delight of the spectators.</p>

<p>Others were practising the broad and standing
jump; and close by the apparatus used for the high
jump was in constant use, the crossbar falling from
the uprights again and again, as some aspirant’s foot
caught in going over.</p>

<p>Still there were several fine jumpers among those
who kept trying, and the crossbar was moved up
inch by inch as they cleared it handsomely, amid the
plaudits of the admiring throng.</p>

<p>Further on the pole-vaulters were making their
swift little run, and rising to clear their elevated
bar. Of course in this particular there were numerous
failures, and some of the jumpers had bothersome
falls. One boy went off limping, and assisted
by a friend, having bruised his leg painfully.</p>

<p>But these things must be expected among a parcel
of untrained schoolboys, whose muscles are not as
hard as they should be.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>Somehow Lanky and Frank were more interested
in the work of the sprinters, for that was in their
own line. They timed some of the dashes, and exchanged
satisfied looks. There seemed to be considerable
talent among this class; and unless the
rival schools developed a marvel or two, they would
have all they could do to keep at the heels of these
lively Columbia lads.</p>

<p>From time to time the two boys were hailed by
those they knew best; and Lanky seemed to be in
an unusually fine humor, even for him. But Frank,
of course, understood the reason for this. He could
see that Lanky somehow turned his head, and looked
at nearly every newcomer. He seemed to think
there would be a messenger from the telegraph office
hunting him up; since the answer to his message was
sure to be marked “very important.”</p>

<p>Loud voices attracted their attention later on, and
Frank was sorry to discover that some of the Columbia
boys were engaged in a wordy dispute with the
big crowd of Bellport students who had come over
in a fighting mood.</p>

<p>“It’s a put-up job, that’s what it is!” one of the
latter was saying, roughly.</p>

<p>“Yes, things have all got a string on ’em,” added
another, with a sneer. “It’s no wonder Columbia
nearly always wins when they know how to pull the
wires, and get the inside track! On even terms,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
Bellport would lick you out of your boots; and I
don’t care who hears me say it.”</p>

<p>“Oh! come off now,” remonstrated a Columbia
boy; “you know better than that, Sim Reeves.
We’ve been beaten by Bellport and Clifford, and
beaten fairly, too. Did we kick, and set up a howl
of fraud? Not much. We took off our hats to the
victors, and said we were sorry to admit that they
were the better fellows that day; but we hoped to
tell a different story another time.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you did!” jeered a third Bellport fellow.
“Right now you’ve got this competition all cooked
up, so that the plums will fall to Columbia. Wasn’t
it engineered by a Columbia gentleman, who put up
all the money for the prizes? Sure it was; and
the committee just hated to think of any of those
fine medals going to Bellport, so they arranged
things to give the home crowd all the advantage.”</p>

<p>“Prove it by showing us a single thing that isn’t
square!” cried an angry Columbia student, shaking
his fist at the speaker.</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! they covered their tracks all right,”
the Bellport boy flung back. “Being used to such
tricks, they can do it so nobody could just put a
finger on anything; but all the same the feeling is
there that we’re going to be buncoed right from the
start.”</p>

<p>“Huh! if I felt that way I wouldn’t take part in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
the meet at all!” called out one of the touchy Columbia
boys.</p>

<p>“Perhaps we won’t,” came the immediate answer.
“A lot of us have come over here to-day, not so
much to see what you’re all doing, as to tell you what
they think in Bellport of your committee’s work.
We know there are a <i>few</i> square fellers in Columbia;
but the majority aren’t standin’ back on taking advantage
of a crooked deal arranged for them by
their committee.”</p>

<p>Frank was shocked at hearing such talk. He
knew that the better class of Bellport fellows would
never stand for it; but was afraid that the two
schools might be drawn into a dispute that would
put a stop to all their friendly rivalry in field and
track sports.</p>

<p>“Bellport’s sore because of that football drubbing
she got last fall!” called out a Columbia backer, one
word leading to another, as is always the case when
boys get to accusing each other.</p>

<p>“And the hockey game that went against her, not
to mention baseball!” echoed still another warm adherent
of the local school.</p>

<p>“Oh! be a sport, and take your medicine! You’ve
all got an even chance to win, and I don’t believe
there’s a Columbia fellow who’ll accept a medal, or
a prize, if he thought he’d been favored in the least!”</p>

<p>But the war of words went on from bad to worse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
All sorts of accusations began to pass between the
two crowds, for the Bellport boys had come over
with the full intention of making trouble.</p>

<p>While they were having it in this fashion who
should come in sight but Chief Hogg, dressed as
usual in his resplendent uniform. Someone had
managed to telephone to police headquarters that
there was danger of a riot among the boys at the
recreation field; and the head of the local force had
pompously driven out there.</p>

<p>But if anybody expected that the appearance of
the stout chief would stop the tongues of that rough
Bellport crowd they were mistaken. They jeered at
the sight of the policeman’s uniform, and matters
seemed getting worse than ever.</p>

<p>The Columbia girls huddled up in groups, watching
the excited boys argue, while arms were waved,
and sticks shaken. Frank had seen all this, and having
a sudden inspiration he hurried into the building
where the telephone was located.</p>

<p>“I want to get Bellport in a hurry,” he said to the
girl who, during these times, had charge of the
booth at the sporting field.</p>

<p>“I can do that for you right away; but what
number do you want?” she asked; and as Frank
looked up from consulting the slender little book
that had the names of all the telephone subscribers
in the three river towns, he replied:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>“Give me 57-L, Bellport, please.”</p>

<p>A minute later she called:</p>

<p>“57-L, Bellport. Here you are!”</p>

<p>“Hello! is this Mr. Lee’s house?” asked Frank,
and was immediately electrified by hearing a voice
he readily recognized, making reply.</p>

<p>“Yes, who is that talking?”</p>

<p>“Frank Allen, over in Columbia; is that you,
Cuthbert?”</p>

<p>“That’s who it is; how are you, Frank; what’s
doing in the athletic line?” came over the wire.</p>

<p>“A whole lot, Cuthbert,” Frank replied quickly.
“I’m out at our athletic field right now. There are
some hundreds here, and a lot of our boys practicing
stunts. A bunch of your fellows came over, and
are trying to make trouble. They even jeer at Chief
Hogg, and defy him to lay a hand on them.”</p>

<p>“Thunder! that’s bad; I never dreamed they’d do
such a thing,” came from the astounded boy eight
miles away, down in Bellport.</p>

<p>“Unless something is done pretty soon I’m afraid
there’s going to be trouble here, and some broken
heads,” Frank went on. “And the worst of it all is
that such a rumpus will break off all friendly intercourse
between the two schools for years, perhaps.
Now, I know you have a great influence over the
Bellport boys, Cuthbert. They’ll do more for you
than any fellow living. Can’t you take your motorcycle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and come over here, licketty-split, and save
the day? Please do. It’s the only chance of keeping
peace between the two towns.”</p>

<p>“Frank, I’ll come right away!” answered Cuthbert.
“I don’t know that I can hold those hotheads
in check; but I’m willing to do all I can. So-long!”</p>

<p>Frank went out, hoping that affairs would not
reach a crisis before the athletic leader of the Bellport
school arrived. He tried to soothe the angry
and bitter disputants as best he could, and perhaps
the respect they felt for Frank Allen was one reason
why some of them did not begin to use their fists or
sticks sooner.</p>

<p>The minutes dragged along, and each seemed an
hour to Frank. He knew that there could be no
holding the boys back much longer, for the insults
were growing more and more bitter, and the motions
of arms and sticks more menacing.</p>

<p>“Oh! Frank, can’t you do something to separate
them before they fight?” asked Minnie, when the
boy happened to come close to where a group of
girls stood shivering, and looking frightened at the
war of words.</p>

<p>“I have done what I could,” replied Frank.
“Listen, don’t you hear that popping sound? It’s
Cuthbert Lee on his motorcycle. I ’phoned to him
over home that he was needed here to prevent a
clash, and he’s come on the jump!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XII<br>

<small>A POPULAR BOY</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Frank</span>, you’re a wonder; and I don’t care who
hears me say it!” exclaimed Minnie, as she saw a
cloud of dust down the road, with a boy on a motorcycle
heading it. “Nobody but you would ever have
thought of such a splendid scheme!”</p>

<p>“Well, all I hope, then, is that it works,” replied
the boy; “for they’re just ready to take a whack at
each other right now.”</p>

<p>He ran toward the noisy crowd, and shouted at
the top of his voice:</p>

<p>“Here’s Cuthbert Lee come over to see us, fellows!”</p>

<p>Even the mention of the name of the most popular
boy in all Bellport acted as a soothing salve upon
the excited minds of the wrangling lads. They drew
back just in time to avoid the first blow, which must
have precipitated the battle, and been followed by
bloody noses and bruised faces. Some of them even
began to look ashamed to be caught in such a business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
as creating bad feeling between the neighboring
towns.</p>

<p>Cuthbert Lee was wise enough to know that nothing
could be accomplished by accusing his friends
of wrongdoing. He began by asking the cause
of the trouble, and smoothing things down so ably
that in a short time he had the Bellport boys cheering
him wildly.</p>

<p>“Don’t let anybody think Bellport has a case of
cold feet,” he declared. “We believe we’ve got the
athletes to carry off some of those prizes, anyhow,
and we’re just going to prove it when the time
comes. I’ve watched every arrangement closely,
boys, and I give you my solemn word for it, I honestly
believe the arrangements have all been made
in a spirit of fairness.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” shouted a Columbia boy, beginning
to be once more drawn toward the old rivals
of Bellport, whom they had cheered wildly many a
time after a game had been won or lost, and respected
in the past as true sport-lovers.</p>

<p>“Why,” continued Cuthbert, feeling that his case
was already as good as won, “at the meeting which
I had the honor to attend, the gentleman who offered
these fine prizes was <i>very</i> particular to say, time
after time, that he wanted the neighboring towns
to feel that they had just as good a chance to win
as Columbia. He was so broad-minded, fellows,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
that once our representative had to actually object,
and say that Bellport didn’t need to be favored.
Does that look like the committee meant to side-track
us? I never knew of a fairer arrangement between
schools than the one governing this meet.
And that’s positive truth, believe me, fellows. You
know I wouldn’t deceive you for anything in the
world.”</p>

<p>They began to look very foolish now and the
Columbia boys were giving Cuthbert Lee a salvo
of loud cheers. Such friendly sentiments touched
their boyish hearts as nothing else could do.</p>

<p>“Let’s call it off, boys!” cried one Bellport fellow,
who had been among the noisiest of the disputants.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry we made the trouble at all!” said another,
frankly.</p>

<p>“We’ve been a lot of silly jacks, that’s what!”
cried a third; “and for one I’m in favor of asking
the pardon of every Columbia High fellow, right
here and now. Hear that, Frank Allen? It was
all a mistake, and we’re sorry.”</p>

<p>“We hope you’ll forget the unpleasantness, Columbia!”</p>

<p>“And let’s be better friends than ever because of
it,” called out Cuthbert Lee. “When we felt the
disappointment of defeat on the gridiron or the
diamond I tell you it took a lot of the sting out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
of it to hear fair and square Frank Allen and his
crowd giving a bully cheer for Bellport. And, fellows,
we can’t afford to show such a nasty little
spirit as to believe those honest enemies of last
summer and fall could get down low enough to
even think of cheating. Who’s with me in giving
three and a tiger right now for the boys of Columbia
High?”</p>

<p>Well, they were given, and with a roar. Not a
single Bellport boy felt that he could afford to hold
back when Cuthbert Lee led the shouting. And in
five minutes the change in the aspect of things on
that athletic field was magical. Instead of keeping
together in a crowd, and badgering the workers,
the visitors separated, and each fellow seemed to
be the center of a group of Columbia students, both
boys and girls, as they watched the continuance of
the practice games.</p>

<p>Good-natured chaffing had taken the place of
jarring remarks intended to cut to the quick. The
clouds had rolled away, and a fair sky overhead
had succeeded the storm signals.</p>

<p>“That was the brightest thing you ever did,
Frank,” remarked Cuthbert Lee, as he stood with
a number of others, and chatted together concerning
the various contests scheduled for the great
athletic meet on the following week.</p>

<p>“<i>One</i> of them, perhaps,” remarked Minnie,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
proudly; at which there was a general laugh from
the boys and girls, and consequently more or less
blushing on the part of the pretty speaker.</p>

<p>“I’m glad I had the idea, anyway,” replied Frank;
“because it began to look as if there was going to
be a riot, sure thing. When boys get warmed up
they never mince words; and I heard some pretty
strong language used. But it’s ended just as it
should, and maybe has drawn the rival schools
closer together.”</p>

<p>“I guess they let off all their spare steam, anyhow,”
remarked Ralph Langworthy, who had been
engaged in some of the sprinting trials, and was
showing considerable speed in the hundred-yard
dash.</p>

<p>Evidently the news had reached Columbia, for men
were constantly arriving at the athletic field. They
seemed anxious on coming, but soon discovered that
there must be some sort of mistake about the trouble
that had been reported imminent; for Columbia and
Bellport had never appeared so friendly as just then,
and Chief Hogg was telling humorous stories to
the keeper of the grounds.</p>

<p>Lanky was very glum as he stood around. Frank
could easily guess the cause for this. Dora had
stayed down in Columbia over the holiday, instead
of going back to the farm; and she was to be seen
in the society of the good-looking Walter Ackerman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
’most all the morning. Indeed, Frank, seeing
her glance quickly toward his chum a number of
times, could understand that she was carrying on
in this way simply to annoy Lanky. And as he
declined to notice her even a little bit, it began to
look as though the breach had grown too great to
be easily bridged.</p>

<p>“H’m!” said Frank to himself, “it doesn’t look
as though Minnie had been very successful in making
Dora see how silly she was in quarreling with
poor Lanky, after he’s been taking her around everywhere
since he met her up on the farm, at the time
we saved the house from burning down. I must
get her to try again, though. But in cases like this
it isn’t much use. Dora is set on snubbing him; and
Lanky wouldn’t shake hands with her, when she
started to make up.”</p>

<p>Frank and Lanky managed to get together on
the trip home, though a bevy of girls walked close
by; and Minnie doubtless wondered what important
business took Frank from her side even for five
minutes.</p>

<p>“If you get a wire, call me up, Lanky, sure,”
Frank was saying.</p>

<p>“Will I? Well, you can wager I will, right speedy
now,” came the answer. “I need your advice all
the time, so’s to keep from makin’ a botched job<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
of this thing. I hope it comes by to-morrow, though,
or Saturday.”</p>

<p>“Well, if it don’t, I’ll be disappointed myself,”
remarked Frank.</p>

<p>“For one thing,” the other went on, “those gyps
aren’t a-goin’ to hang around these diggings forever,
you know.”</p>

<p>“Of course not,” agreed Frank.</p>

<p>“They’ll be foldin’ up their tents and silently
stealin’ away, as the poem has it,” Lanky continued;
“and then where’d I be if I got word, when it was
too late, that the lost child did wear that same kind
of a little bonnet, with the blue ribbon on it?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps there might be some way to coax them
to stay a while longer,” suggested Frank, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>“How, for instance?” questioned Lanky, eagerly.</p>

<p>“Well, they’re sharp enough to know that with a
big event coming off, like our athletic meet, a crowd
of people will be coming to Columbia; and such a
time is always good for horse trading, and such
things. I’m going to set the wheels going, so as
to make them see this. One camp is just as good
as another to them, I guess, and so they’ll be glad
to stay over.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you ain’t the greatest hand at gettin’
up schemes I ever knew!” declared Lanky, warmly,
as he gripped his chum’s hand and shook it. “Now,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
why didn’t I think of that plan? A gay old head
I’ve got; ain’t worth shucks sometimes. Reckon
some people are just about right in shaking such
a fellow!” he added, gloomily.</p>

<p>“Cheer up!” said Frank, slapping him on the back.
“All this is going to be changed, just as if a wizard
touched it with his magic wand. You wait and see
what’s going to happen. I just feel it in my bones.”</p>

<p>Lanky did brighten up a little; and then, as he
happened to catch sight of that aggravating couple
ahead, Dora chattering away like a little magpie,
and that handsome curly head of Walter so close
to her brown tresses, he gritted his teeth again and
lapsed into his former gloomy state.</p>

<p>So Frank went back to Minnie and the laughing
group of which the gay girl was the center and the
life.</p>

<p>No call came over the wire from Lanky that
afternoon or evening, much to Frank’s disappointment.
And when he met his chum at school on
Wednesday morning, there was a skeptical look on
the thin countenance of Lanky that told of “hopes
deferred making the heart sick.”</p>

<p>“No use talking,” the other declared, in a disgusted
tone, “I’m a regular Jonah nowadays. Never
touch a thing but it flops upside-down. Now, if
it’d been only you connected with this racket, Frank,
chances are you’d ’a’ had a message before now;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
and the father and mother’d be on their way here.
But I’ve just queered the game, that’s what. Everything’s
against me, I do believe.”</p>

<p>“Oh! wait a while,” said Frank, encouragingly.
“It’s plain that your wire hasn’t reached the gentleman
yet; because, if his little girl hasn’t been found
you can just believe that he’d seize on any chance
to hear news. And when he does get the telegram
you’ll know it. If he’s off somewhere, it may be
several days before they can reach him; but it will
come, Lanky, it’s bound to come. So I say wait,
and just hold your horses the best you know how.”</p>

<p>“All right, Frank,” replied Lanky. “I’ll do the
best I can; but I’m badgered if I don’t feel sore,
the way things are knocking me. But I’m all
trimmed for making that long run Saturday; and
you and Bones’ll have to hustle if you want to get
home anywhere near my time; for I’m going to
show <i>somebody</i> something, you understand!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>ON THE HARRAPIN</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Saturday</span> saw quite a big crowd gathered in the
afternoon at the athletic field, to witness what they
called the “elimination trials.” By this means all
who could not take part in the grand meet the following
week would be weeded out.</p>

<p>There were plenty of young people present from
both Bellport and Clifford; for it was expected that
these trial heats would prove almost as interesting
as the real thing later on. Of course this was a
Columbia day entirely, a sort of home affair, since
only local boys could compete.</p>

<p>One event after another was carried out by the
judges who were appointed to decide upon the merits
of the numerous candidates. Even sack racing was
indulged in; and the antics of fat Buster Billings
when he strove with might and main to come in
ahead of his more nimble rivals afforded great fun.
He even started to rolling when unable to get on
his feet again after a fall, and might have won, only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
that this method of making progress was declared
barred by those in charge.</p>

<p>Some of the jumping tests were well carried out;
and those who watched and figured on the marks
made nodded their heads as though satisfied that
Columbia had a good chance in this quarter.</p>

<p>The high-jumpers also held a carnival of their
own, and brought out loud cheers by their showing;
while the pole-vaulters, the shot-putters and hammer-throwers
and the short-distance sprinters gave every
evidence of being grimly determined not to lose
the prizes offered in their departments, if grit and
pluck and muscle could win out.</p>

<p>Finally, at four o’clock the long-distance runners
lined up; and as this was the last, as well as the most
important event, on the program, everybody crowded
around to witness the start. There was a lot of
cross-fire talk between some of the ambitious aspirants
and their friends on the side lines.</p>

<p>Besides Frank, Lanky and Bones Shadduck, the
three who were fully expected to carry off the honors,
and get tickets to enter the Marathon in the
big meet, there were almost a dozen others, who
seemed to have hopes of developing into wonders;
or else meant to start, just for the fun of the thing.</p>

<p>Since that day in school, when the fire occurred
in the basement, nothing had been seen or heard
of Bill Klemm and his two cronies, Asa Barnes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
and Watkins Kline. Asa’s father, the local butcher,
had been searching all over the country for his son;
but thus far nothing had been heard from him.
It was believed that, thinking they must have caused
the destruction of the school by fire, the frightened
trio of boys were hiding far away, not daring to
return home. And among the crowds that gathered
on this Saturday, their names were often mentioned,
as all sorts of queer theories were advanced to account
for their disappearance.</p>

<p>But then, as they were most unpopular boys, no
one cared very much about it. And really the games
that were being carried out were ten times more
worth talking about than the fortunes of such a town
bully as Bill Klemm, or his followers, who were
trying to walk in the same trail he followed.</p>

<p>It had been determined that since this was only
a trial race, with the result really a foregone conclusion,
the boys would not have to go over the entire
circuit as laid out for the great meet. Instead of ten
miles, they would cover just half that distance.</p>

<p>With the crack of the starter’s pistol the long
line jumped away. Several ambitious beginners
immediately sprinted, and took the lead.</p>

<p>“Look at Ginger Harper, would you?” cried a
spectator; “why, he’s a wonder, for a fact. He can
run around the rest of that bunch, and not half try.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
There he goes, grabbin’ off the yards like fun. It’s
going to be a procession, with Ginger first!”</p>

<p>“Is it?” remarked Jack Eastwick, with a grin of
pity for the ignorance of the shouter, who was a particular
friend of the Harper boy, he knew; “maybe
so, maybe not.”</p>

<p>Those who knew better saw that the good runners
did not start at headlong pace. They held back
in a bunch, and were saving their wind. In a run
that covers five or ten miles it is the height of
folly to make any effort at great speed at the start.
By degrees experienced and knowing runners get
into their stride, and in this fashion are able to
finish strongly. That home stretch to them means
everything, and when the crack of the pistol announces
that it has been entered, they seem to exhibit
all the freshness of those just starting.</p>

<p>So the last of the runners disappeared from sight,
and the crowd went back to watch a few more minor
events while waiting for the return of the five-mile
contestants.</p>

<p>“Pretty near time they began to show up; isn’t
it?” asked Jack Comfort, who was well pleased
with the showing he had made that day, and fully
assured that he would be the one selected to compete
for Columbia with the weight-throwing and shot-putting
squad.</p>

<p>A shout was heard just then.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>“A runner in sight!” passed along the lines, and
immediately everything else was neglected, while the
crowd formed a long double lane from the outskirts
of the field to the tape, which the contestants
had to breast in order to have their time taken.</p>

<p>“Who is it? Ginger Harper making it a sweep?”
cried one, mockingly.</p>

<p>“Say, Ginger’s been back here these ten minutes
and more,” called out another. “He gave out at the
first half-mile stone, and came home to see the run-in!”</p>

<p>“It’s Frank Allen!” arose the shout.</p>

<p>“You’re all mistaken, for it’s Lanky Wallace.
Don’t you see how tall he is; and aren’t we all of
us on to his way of running!” whooped Buster Billings,
red in the face with all he had been attempting
in various lines.</p>

<p>“Lanky Wallace leads!”</p>

<p>“Three Lankies for cheers!” shrieked Red Huggins,
who always managed to get his sentences
twisted when excited, and as some of the boys said,
“got the cart before the horse.”</p>

<p>“And he’s beat his best time by a whole lot, too!”
announced another enthusiast.</p>

<p>Some of the Bellport and Clifford boys were seen
comparing watches as Lanky came bounding along
with tremendous strides, making for the tape-line,
and apparently they were staggered to realize what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
small chance their athletes had in comparison with
this wonder.</p>

<p>“If he kept to the track he’s the best ever!” one
fellow said, shaking his head as though he could
hardly believe it.</p>

<p>“There’s another runner, and this time it is Frank
Allen!”</p>

<p>“With Bones close behind him; and the field out
of sight!”</p>

<p>“Oh! some of those fellows will be comin’ in for
the next hour!” laughed Buster.</p>

<p>Lanky shot along the double line of shouting admirers,
and breasted the tape in gallant style. And
had Frank been there to notice, he would have smiled
to see how the winner’s first thought was to cast
a contemptuous look over to that quarter where
pretty little Dora Baxter stood clapping her hands
gleefully, just as though for the moment it was forgotten
that she and Lanky had ever had a falling
out.</p>

<p>Frank was delighted with the wonderful time
made by his long-legged chum. Surely Lanky had
improved very much since the last time they entered
for a long-distance run. And if either of the rival
schools could show a better runner, he would have
to be a marvel indeed.</p>

<p>Of course the three who were to enter for Columbia
were those who had come in first, second and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
third. The fourth did not arrive for ten minutes
or more after Bones Shadduck passed the tape; and
when most of the crowd had left the field the others
were still showing up—some limping from stone-bruises,
and others utterly fagged out from the
long grind.</p>

<p>And if five miles could put them in this condition
of exhaustion, it was very evident that they could
not have a grain of hope of ever getting over the
entire course of double that distance.</p>

<p>Lanky had gone to the dressing-room, and soon
appeared in his ordinary clothes. He took his honors
meekly; indeed, Frank suspected that the boy
would really have cared more to hear one girl say a
single word of admiration, than to hear scores load
him down with praise.</p>

<p>But Dora had gone off with a group, and was not
to be seen. Evidently she had rightly interpreted
that look of scorn Lanky had thrown toward her
at the moment of his triumph, as though to tell her
he did not care to see her applauding anything which
he might do.</p>

<p>“Hey! Lanky, come and go back with us to town
on board the <i>Harrapin Belle</i>!” said Ben Allison,
whacking the tall boy between the shoulders as he
started off alone.</p>

<p>“Oh! don’t care if I do, Ben,” replied Lanky,
never dreaming to what a strange end this trivial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
incident might lead him; “if your boat isn’t too
crowded.”</p>

<p>“Huh! nothing’s too good for you this day,
Lanky,” replied the other; “and I’d pitch a few of
the others overboard to make room for the boy
who’s going to bring victory our way next week.
We’re sure proud of the way you covered that five-mile
course to-day, and that’s the truth. Here, hook
your arm with mine. It’s an honor to be seen walking
with you, Lanky, let me tell you.”</p>

<p>“Is it?” queried Lanky, gloomily; “some people
don’t think that way, Ben. But I’m wondering if
Frank Allen couldn’t have run me a hot race if he
wanted.”</p>

<p>“Rats! Frank did the best he could,” retorted Ben.
“I heard him say so.”</p>

<p>And so, arguing in this friendly spirit, they finally
came to the river, where a number of boats of all
sorts lay, having come for the most part from the
other towns.</p>

<p>The <i>Harrapin Belle</i> was a big launch that Ben’s
father had bought early that season. It had been
second-hand, but was in fair condition. More than
a dozen boys and girls were going back to town on
board, having been invited by generous Ben, and
evidently bent on enjoying a little river trip to vary
the monotony of things.</p>

<p>Lanky discovered, when it was too late, that Dora<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>
and Walter Ackerman were aboard, sitting far up
in the bow. He kept away from that quarter
studiously; and, as the boat started up the river,
busied himself in appearing to be utterly care-free.</p>

<p>They had not gone more than a few hundred
yards before the pilot managed to run against some
sort of snag, which was unseen above the surface of
the water. No particular damage to the boat resulted;
but there was quite a little shock. And then
came a scream in a voice that seemed familiar to
Lanky.</p>

<p>Springing to his feet he dashed toward the bow.
The boat was floating with the current now, the
power having been turned off. Several of the boys
and girls were bending over the side, gazing in
alarm at something that was occurring there; and
among them Lanky could see Walter Ackerman.</p>

<p>But he failed to discover Dora; and the truth
broke upon him that it must be the girl who had
once been so dear a friend to him, who had fallen
into the river at the time of the collision!</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>LANKY FINDS HIS CHANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">There</span> she is!”</p>

<p>“Oh! why doesn’t somebody jump overboard,
and save her, poor thing?” cried Helen Allen; at
the same time clinging to Paul Bird so desperately
that he could not have attempted the rescue act,
even though inclined that way.</p>

<p>Lanky seized hold of Walter Ackerman.</p>

<p>“She was with you!” he shouted; “why don’t
you go in after her?”</p>

<p>The handsome boy never looked as he did then,
white in the face, and frightened.</p>

<p>“I would; indeed, I’d do it in a minute—but I
can’t swim a stroke!” he gasped.</p>

<p>Without waiting to hear another word Lanky
threw him contemptuously aside, “just as he might
a sack of oats,” Helen afterwards said, in describing
it all to Frank.</p>

<p>One look Lanky cast over the side, as he kicked
his shoes off, and sent his jacket flying after them.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
This showed him a white face in the midst of the
water, and, he thought, a pair of hands held out
toward him.</p>

<p>Then Lanky jumped.</p>

<p>The <i>Harrapin Belle</i> careened far over on the
port side, because everyone aboard had hastened
to that quarter, in order to learn what happened.
They saw Lanky come to the surface after his dive,
and fling the water out of his eyes. Then he struck
out for the spot where the girl seemed to be struggling,
trying to swim perhaps; for Dora was known
to possess that accomplishment, though her skirts
bothered her considerably now.</p>

<p>“Hurray! he’s got her!” whooped Ben Allison,
in great excitement.</p>

<p>“Bully for our Lanky; he’s just the screamer to-day,
though! Won the long run; and now saved
the prettiest girl outside of Columbia town!” shouted
another boy.</p>

<p>The girls were clapping their hands, and almost
wishing that fortune had been kind enough to let
them figure in the rôle of a heroine; though the
water did look pretty wet, and it was evidently very
deep right at this point in the Harrapin.</p>

<p>“We must get them in, fellows!” called Ben, as
he gave the signal for the boy at the engine to
back the boat down the current.</p>

<p>“Oh! be careful, Ben, and don’t run over them!”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
begged Helen, as a new fear began to tug at her
heart.</p>

<p>“I’ll look out,” came the confident reply, as the
boat started slowly to follow the current, and gain
on the struggling couple.</p>

<p>But Lanky was not worrying a bit. He had his
arm tight around the waist of Dora, and was easily
keeping himself afloat, for he was a good swimmer—almost
like a duck in the water, his mates used to
say.</p>

<p>“Are you all right, Dora?” he asked, wondering
whether she had retained her senses through it all.</p>

<p>She clung all the tighter to him, as though that
alone ought to answer his question. Perhaps, after
it was all over, Dora would treat him just as coldly
as ever; but while it lasted Lanky was not “caring
whether school kept or not,” as he described it.</p>

<p>They were soon enabled to reach the side of the
boat; and as some of the boys above reached down
their hands, Dora’s dripping figure was quickly
drawn up. But it might have been noticed that the
girl studiously avoided touching the hand of Walter
Ackerman. He was bound to pay a heavy penalty
for never having learned to swim.</p>

<p>“His cake is dough, all right!” was the way Paul
Bird expressed it to Helen, after he had seen this
aversion on the part of the rescued girl. “And I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
guess there’s just going to be all peace between
Lanky and Dora after this.”</p>

<p>“It’s just wonderful, that’s all I can say!” exclaimed
Frank’s young sister. “If it had been a
page out of a story it couldn’t have happened nicer.
But they’re helping Lanky up now. Oh! isn’t he
just dripping, though?”</p>

<p>“But he rather likes it,” Paul went on to say.
“Lanky always was a sort of water-dog. I’ve known
him to spend the best part of a day in the river.
You couldn’t drown him if you tried. See him
grin, will you, when he looks at poor Walter, who’s
got to take a back seat after this, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Well, serves him right!” declared Helen.
“Every boy ought to know how to swim, if he ever
expects a girl to feel confidence in him at all. And
I’m so glad that <i>you</i> can, Paul.”</p>

<p>Lanky Wallace no longer looked glum and unhappy.
He realized that fortune had beamed upon
him that day in a way he could never have dreamed
would happen. It was not enough that he should
come in far ahead of the field in that long run, beating
the best amateur time known in that section
of the country for a five-mile race; but now this
had come about in the bargain.</p>

<p>Dora was wrapped in a rug they had aboard.
Lanky disdained to bother himself about his wet
clothes. He managed to get his shoes on, after an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
effort and covered his shoulders with his jacket.
He said he felt as “warm as toast”; and perhaps
from the way his heart was pounding away inside,
he had good reason for declaring this.</p>

<p>And now, when he caught those dancing eyes of
Dora which he used to think were the prettiest
and sauciest he had ever seen, he found no reason
to scowl, and hasten to avert his gaze, for they
sparkled with happiness, and his every glance met
a smile.</p>

<p>Finally, before they reached town, he saw Dora
beckoning imperiously to him; just as in those old
days before the quarrel, Lanky jumped to obey.</p>

<p>She held out her little hand, and he clasped it
eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m going with Helen to dry my clothes,”
the girl said in a low tone, “and if you could come
for me in about half an hour in some sort of a
vehicle, Lanky, I’d be ever so much obliged to you
to take me up home.”</p>

<p>“Will I? Well, I guess yes, and glad in the bargain,
Dora,” he replied, with a happy look that told
her the bitterness had all gone out of his heart.</p>

<p>“You’ll forgive me being so unkind to you; won’t
you, Lanky?” she continued, as Helen very considerately
turned away.</p>

<p>“Never mention it again to me, Dora. I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
to forget we ever had a falling out,” the boy went
on, rapidly.</p>

<p>“And we’re going to be friends again, then, good
friends like we used to be?” she continued, gladness
in her voice.</p>

<p>“Better than ever—that is, if you care to have
me take you around, instead of <i>him</i>,” Lanky replied
suggestively, and her pretty face took on a
very scornful look as she went on:</p>

<p>“Him! Oh! I despise him now, too much for me
to tell you. I never did care so much for him, Lanky,
and was only trying to make you believe I did.
But to think of him willing to see me drown there!
Oh! the coward! I never, never mean to even speak
to him again!”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Lanky, feeling a little compunction
in his generous heart toward the unlucky object of
this girlish disdain; “p’raps he isn’t to blame so
much after all, because he says he can’t swim even
a little bit; and if that’s so, you know he couldn’t
’a’ helped you a whit, even if he had jumped over.”</p>

<p>“That doesn’t matter,” she persisted, girl-like;
“if he’d been real brave, like some boys I know,
he’d have jumped in, anyway. Why, I might have
saved him then, don’t you see, Lanky? Mr. Walter
Ackerman had better go and take lessons in swimming
before he expects any Columbia girl to be
his company again. They all know him now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>Lanky looked at her a little queerly. He was in
reality wondering whether, after all, the plucky girl
might not have been pretending to be in greater peril
than was actually the case, after finding herself
dumped into the river, just to see which one of her
boy friends would do the life-saving act. But he
never knew whether there was any truth in this
far-fetched idea or not.</p>

<p>Although Lanky Wallace had won considerable
renown that day by reason of his leading the string
of long-distance runners, and by such remarkable
time, he seemed to think more of the fact that he
was expected to get a rig, and take Dora to the farm
of her parents, quite a number of miles north of
Columbia, where the Harrapin became almost like
a creek.</p>

<p>Lanky could look back to pleasant days spent at
that same farm. And yet he really believed that he
had never contemplated visiting the Baxter home
with more lively anticipations of pleasure than on
this occasion.</p>

<p>Promptly at the time appointed he drove up to
the Allen house with a horse and buggy. That it
was not a thoroughbred Lanky privately admitted
to Frank, when the other joked him on the appearance
of the steed.</p>

<p>“That’s all right,” he said in Frank’s ear; “takes
longer to get there. Some people, when they’ve<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
got a good thing, don’t know how to string it out.
I do. That’s why I declined the use of a horse that
could go a mile in three minutes. Why, honest
now, Frank, this nag’s so steady that the livery man
said a one-armed boy could drive him.”</p>

<p>No doubt, on the long ride up to the farm a full
explanation and reconciliation took place between
Lanky and Dora. He only too gladly forgave her
when she pleaded that she was only a silly little girl,
but that she had learned a lesson; and they agreed
to be as good friends as ever.</p>

<p>It must have been fully midnight when Lanky
drove that “very steady” horse at a pretty swift
pace back into town, and the way the animal covered
the ground on the return journey might have
surprised Dora, could she have known of his performance.</p>

<p>And Lanky had good reason to feel rather well
satisfied with the events of that Saturday, which
must always be marked with a white stone in his
history.</p>

<p>There was now only one more thing on his mind—the
clearing of the mystery concerning the
identity of the little child in the gypsy camp. No
word had as yet come from the party to whom he
had sent that long message, costing himself and his
chum more than three dollars. In another week
the great athletic meet was to take place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>“Well,” mused Lanky, as he prepared to go to
bed in the small hours of Sunday morning, after
returning the rig to the livery stable where it had
been procured; “I hope something <i>will</i> turn up before
the gypsies move away. I’d hate to spend
all that coin for nothing; and never know whether
I was a smart guesser, or just a simple fool, for
thinking that baby girl could be the long-lost Effie
Elverson. P’raps I’m due for another little streak
of luck. They say it always hunts in threes. But,
as Frank tells me, I mustn’t worry. This business
came out jolly well; and p’raps the other may.
Wow! but I’m sleepy, though, and that bed looks
fine. So it is good-night for me.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XV<br>

<small>AN ACCIDENT BETRAYS RUFUS</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">I guess</span> yesterday was your big day, all right,
Lanky!”</p>

<p>Frank laughed as he made this remark. It was
Sunday afternoon, and he was taking a little stroll
with his chum, “just to show the natives that they
were as fresh as daisies after that five-mile Marathon
yesterday,” as Lanky put it.</p>

<p>“Well, it did come pretty thick and fast, for a
fact,” admitted the one for whom the remark was
intended. “But my mother had pity on me, and
let me sleep late this fine Sunday morning. Just
got up in time to dress, have my breakfast, and then
go to church.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry I missed that little affair on the river,”
Frank went on. “From all the accounts I heard,
it must have been a great time.”</p>

<p>“It sure was a dandy picnic, Frank,” admitted the
other, without hesitation, and drawing in a long
breath, as imagination once more transported him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
back to the moment when he held Dora up with his
right arm, and used the left to keep both of them
afloat.</p>

<p>“And you went all the way up to the Baxter
farm afterwards, they say, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Oh! it isn’t so very far,” remonstrated the other.
“The river makes a lot of turns, you know; and
when a fellow is skating, it seems longer than when
you’re in a buggy, on the main road, alongside a
girl, and there’s just <i>heaps</i> to be explained.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Lanky, it does,” replied Frank, with
a knowing look. “And I reckon it was all explained,
too, long before you got to the Baxter place?”</p>

<p>“Smooth sailing from this on, Frank,” the other
quickly retorted. “You see, when poor old Walter,
with all his good looks, had to own up that he
couldn’t swim a little bit, with Dora in the river
a-waitin’ for somebody to do the rescue act, even if
she can swim better’n any girl around Columbia,
it just made her disgusted with such a poor stick.
Anyhow, she told me she never had cared much for
him, and was goin’ home from choir meetin’s with
Walter just because she was mean, and wanted to
hurt me. But it’s all right now, Frank; and I guess
we’re better friends than ever before.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s going some,” remarked Frank,
knowingly. “But, Lanky, how in the wide world
did you put on such an immense amount of steam<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>
in the last half mile? Why, I saw in a jiffy that I
was a back number yesterday, and there was no
use of a fellow trying to head you off. You
went like the wind, I tell you. Give me the secret,
if you don’t mind. It might come handy in the big,
long run.”</p>

<p>“Shucks! it’s nothin’, after all,” replied Lanky.
“I just kept thinkin’ of her, and how sorry she’d
feel that our friendship was busted, when she saw
me come in first, and heard everybody yelling. And
she was, Frank, she admitted that to me. Why,
she even couldn’t help jumpin’ up, and clappin’ her
little hands, forgettin’ right then that there had ever
been a wide gulf come between us. But it’s all right
now, Frank, and there’s no such silly spat goin’ to
happen any more. We both promised that.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m glad that Walter has become a back
number,” Frank observed; “because I knew you were
worrying a lot about losing such a good little friend
as Dora. You always did think a heap of her, right
from the start. Remember the time that tramp set
their farmhouse afire, after robbing them; and when
we were skating up that way we had a roaring time
putting out the blaze?”</p>

<p>“That was sure a screaming old time, Frank; I
think of it often, and how pretty Dora did look, with
her rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes.”</p>

<p>“Hold on, let’s change the subject,” broke in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
Frank, with a laugh. “I suppose now, you’re beginning
to think your wire went astray, and that we’ll
never hear from that Mr. Elverson?”</p>

<p>Lanky sobered up instantly.</p>

<p>“Say, three and a quarter gone up the flume,
Frank,” he remarked, shrugging his shoulders in
an expressive way. “Not that I’m carin’ so much
for the hard cash, if only it ended in somethin’.
But it comes in too slow to be just thrown away like
that.”</p>

<p>“Wait,” said Frank, as he had done before; “the
game isn’t over yet, by a long sight, Lanky. Sooner
or later that message is just bound to catch up with
Mr. Elverson; and if he hasn’t found his little Effie
yet, it’ll bring an answer as fast as he can get it on
the wires.”</p>

<p>“But the gypsies’ll sure vamoose long before
that!” expostulated Lanky.</p>

<p>“Let ’em go,” Frank went on, as though he did
not mean to worry over such a little thing. “Between
us we ought to be able to find out some way
to keep tabs on the tribe, no matter where they wander.
And once we hear from the gentleman, if
he hasn’t found his girl, and she <i>did</i> wear such a
baby bonnet as you described, why, it’ll be easy to
get on a train, and go to the town near where they’re
camped right then.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will, Frank,” Lanky admitted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
brightening up like magic. “There never was a
chum like you to see ahead. The fog can’t get so
thick but what you manage to punch a hole in it,
and glimpse light on the other side. Why, of course
we can do what you say. It’s easy as fallin’ off a
log.”</p>

<p>“Then stop bothering your head about it, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“Guess I will,” answered the tall boy, resolutely.</p>

<p>“I told you that other business would come out
all right, sooner or later; didn’t I?” Frank demanded.</p>

<p>“That’s straight goods, Frank.”</p>

<p>“And it did, you noticed, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“It sure did,” was the candid admission of the
other; “but see here, Frank, with all your smartness,
I don’t reckon you ever dreamed it’d happen the way
it did, now?”</p>

<p>“Well, I should say not,” returned Frank, highly
amused. “Why, I never even had the slightest idea
that you meant to go back to town aboard that old
tub of Ben Allison’s; or that a certain young lady
would be a passenger, too. And as to expecting
Ben to steer into a sunken snag, and knock Dora
overboard, why, who’d ever dream of such a thing?
And it all worked out as fine as silk for you. But
you seem to be wanting to turn off the main road
here, and take that one leading to Budd’s Corners?”</p>

<p>“I see you’re onto me, all right,” confessed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
Lanky. “Fact is, Frank, since we’re out for a
little walk, I thought it wouldn’t matter much if
so be we turned in the direction of the gypsy camp.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m willing enough, if you promise me you
won’t go to prowling around when we strike there,
so as to make the men folks notice us. Remember,
Lanky, once we give that sharp old queen any
reason to believe we’ve got an interest in what she’s
got hidden away in that wagon, the game’s up.”</p>

<p>“I hold up my hand and promise you to be careful,”
the tall boy returned, as he went through the
performance. “But looky there what’s comin’ along
back of us like a house afire!”</p>

<p>“Only a boy on a bike, but he’s whooping it up
rather fast,” Frank admitted, as he turned his head
to look.</p>

<p>“Say, I know that feller, all right,” Lanky declared,
as the boy on the wheel rapidly drew nearer
to where they stood on the narrow road.</p>

<p>“Seems to me there’s something familiar about
him, too,” said Frank. “His name is Rufus, isn’t
it, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Right the first guess—Rufus Kline.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that the name of one of Bill Klemm’s
cronies—Watkins Kline?” continued Frank, still
observing the approaching boy on the wheel.</p>

<p>“Yep; and they say his mother is nigh crazy because
nobody’s seen a sign of any of that crowd<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
since they skipped out, after the schoolhouse fire,”
Lanky went on to say.</p>

<p>“Looks like Rufus must have been sent on an
errand this fine Sunday afternoon,” Frank next
remarked; “because I notice that he’s got something
of a bundle tied to the handle-bars of his wheel.
It’s clumsy enough to make him wobble more than
a little as he rides, too.”</p>

<p>“Huh! that surprises me some, too,” Lanky remarked,
as he stood there, watching the boy, who
was now rapidly drawing nearer to them, and appeared
to be wondering whether the two meant to
stand aside and let him pass, or hold him up; in
fact his actions seemed to indicate that Rufus was
bothered not a little.</p>

<p>“Why should it?” demanded Frank, always
ready to learn facts when he could.</p>

<p>“You see,” his chum hastily replied, “Mrs. Kline
is a very religious woman, which makes it all the
more queer why she lets her boy go with such fellers
as Bill Klemm and Asa Barnes. Now, I never’d ’a’
believed she’d sent Rufus on an errand, and carryin’
a package like that, on a Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Oh! you never can tell,” replied Frank. “Perhaps
he’s taking something to a sick woman friend
of hers. There are lots of times when rules have
to be broken, I reckon. But you don’t think of
holding him up, just to ask; do you, Lanky?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“I thought I’d inquire, Frank, just from curiosity,
you see,” with a grin. “They say women-folks
have all the curiosity there is, but I notice that
boys—yes, and men, too—seem to have their share.”</p>

<p>“Hey! get off the road there, and let me past!”
called out Rufus, slackening his speed somewhat,
and looking bothered.</p>

<p>“Where you goin’ this fine Sunday afternoon,
Rufus, and carryin’ that big package, too?” demanded
Lanky. “Don’t you dare run me down, or
somethin’ll happen right quick, understand. Keep
off, now, I tell you!”</p>

<p>Something did happen, and just as speedily as
Lanky had prophesied. Rufus, in his eagerness to
slip by, made a miscalculation; and being also unbalanced
by the sudden swinging of the large bundle
hanging from his handle-bars, he slipped off the
road into the shallow ditch that ran alongside.</p>

<p>As a natural consequence, boy and wheel came
down with a crash.</p>

<p>“Oh! that’s too bad, Lanky; you’ve made him
take a header!” exclaimed Frank. “I hope he isn’t
hurt!”</p>

<p>Rufus was struggling to regain his feet, feeling
of his left leg at the same time, and apparently
hardly knowing whether to cry or get angry. He
finally compromised by whimpering.</p>

<p>“See what you did, Lanky Wallace, by bein’<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
mean, and wantin’ to take the whole road?” he exclaimed,
for Rufus was red-haired, and had a temper,
too, in the bargain.</p>

<p>Lanky stepped over to the wheel, and began to
lift it out of the ditch. Perhaps he was already
sorry for interfering with the lone rider. It had
really been none of his business where the younger
Kline boy happened to be going on his bicycle.
The fact that it was Sunday, and Rufus had a strict
mother, who would not on ordinary occasions allow
him to use his wheel on that day, might have excited
Lanky’s curiosity, but it was no excuse for
him to crowd the boy off the road.</p>

<p>“I oughtn’t to have done it, Rufus,” Lanky
spoke up, with evident contrition in his voice and
manner; “it was sure none of my business where
you happened to be meanderin’ this Sunday afternoon.
The road is free to everybody, gypsy as
well as citizens of Columbia. Here’s your wheel;
and outside of this bent handle-bar it doesn’t look
like there was any damage done. I can straighten
that in a jiffy.”</p>

<p>This he proceeded to do, after hauling the
bicycle up on the road again.</p>

<p>“Frank,” he added, immediately afterward, “will
you pick up that bundle, and tie it on again to the
handle-bar after I get it a little straighter? It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
went flyin’ when the wheel slipped on the road, and
took a flop.”</p>

<p>But Rufus sprang forward, and snatched the
package out of Frank’s hands. There was almost
a fierceness in his manner, that surprised the other
very much.</p>

<p>“Don’t you dare meddle with my things, Frank
Allen!” he cried. “Guess I can tie it up again myself,
without any of your help. Next time you fellers
better keep to one side, and let a wheel go past
without blocking the road. It’s pretty small potatoes
to have two big fellers pick on one little
boy!”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Rufus; and I’m ashamed of myself
for botherin’ you,” admitted Lanky; “there
you are; and nobody’d ever know that handle-bar
had been twisted. It’s weak, anyway, and I reckon
this isn’t the first time she’s bent on you. Want
me to give you a send-off, Rufus?”</p>

<p>“Naw!” snapped the boy, crossly; “just let me
be; and as soon as I’ve got this package of clothin’
my maw’s sendin’ to a sick woman, tied up again,
I’ll be all right. I’d thank you to keep away. I
might ’a’ broke my neck takin’ that header.”</p>

<p>He quickly fastened the recovered package to
the front of the wheel, and mounting from the rear,
was off along the road. Lanky looked queerly at
Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>“That was a silly thing for me to do,” he said.
“I ought to be ashamed of myself to bother a smaller
fellow. That curiosity is a terrible business, Frank.
But looky here, what ails you?”</p>

<p>“I was thinking, that’s all, Lanky. An idea
seemed to just jump into my mind. You noticed
how he didn’t want me to tie up that bundle; didn’t
you?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, he was some touchy, that’s a fact,”
answered the other, slowly, as if unable to understand
what Frank was driving at.</p>

<p>“I saw something of what it contained; and
Lanky, a sick woman might want the loaf of bread,
wedge of cake and the other food; but tell me, what
would she care for boy’s trousers made of corduroy,
like the pair I’ve seen Watkins Kline wear on
Saturdays, when he was off playing?”</p>

<p>Lanky stared all the harder, but the truth began
to seep into his brain.</p>

<p>“Tell me about that!” he exclaimed. “I see
what you mean now, Frank; Rufus is taking supplies
to his brother, who is hiding somewhere in
the woods with Bill Klemm and Asa Barnes! And
he didn’t want us to know it.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVI<br>

<small>LANKY BECOMES A “BARKER”</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">That’s</span> what I was thinking, Lanky,” Frank
remarked, smiling at the excited appearance of his
lengthy chum, who had never fully mastered the
secret of controlling his emotions.</p>

<p>“Well, now, if that don’t just beat the Dutch!”
exclaimed the other, as if almost too amazed to
express himself properly. “And Frank, I don’t
believe either of us would ’a’ got on to the curves
of Rufus, if it hadn’t been for the accident he met
with, that broke open his bundle.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Lanky,” answered Frank,
nodding his head in the affirmative.</p>

<p>“The boys are hiding out somewhere in the
woods, afraid to come home,” went on the tall boy,
with a wide grin; “here days have passed, and
yet they haven’t showed up. Most people are
shakin’ hands with themselves, and sayin’ it’s a
good riddance of bad rubbish; but their folks are
worryin’ some, Frank. It’s low-down mean of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
Watkins Kline to scare his mother so bad. She
never would believe he was bad, you know.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what’s up, and why they hang out
there all this while?” Frank mused.</p>

<p>“Tell you what I think,” remarked his companion,
with a wise look; “I reckon it’s all Bill Klemm’s
doings.”</p>

<p>“What makes you say that, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Why he daren’t come back, you see, till it blows
over,” Lanky went on. “They lay it all to Bill,
and there was a lot of talk about havin’ him sent off
to the reform school. Ten to one Bill’s got wind
of that, and he’s bound to hang out till the people
of Columbia forget the worst of it. Then some
fine day he’ll show up in his old haunts; and ’cept
for a ripple of talk, it won’t be noticed.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve hit the nail on the head, Lanky,”
Frank continued, approvingly. “And not wanting
to stay out in the woods all alone, Bill has put the
screws on Asa and Watkins, keeping them for
company.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk, Frank, as sure as you’re born.
P’raps they calculate to drop in next Wednesday,
when the whole place is wild with interest in the
athletic contests; and nobody’ll have time to bother
any about such small fry as three boys who’ve been
makin’ trouble at school.”</p>

<p>The two had been walking swiftly along while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
chatting in this manner; and were drawing near the
crossroads known far and wide as Budd’s Corners,
because Tom Budd’s father owned most of the
property round about that section.</p>

<p>It was here the gypsy tribe camped, year after
year. Their appearance always created considerable
of a stir through the country. Men visited the
camp to talk horse gossip with the knowing male
members of the tribe. Women sometimes accompanied
them, on the pretense of “just looking
around,” and finding out how these nomads lived;
but secretly in the hope that a chance might arise
whereby they could get their fortune told by someone
connected with the tribe, possibly the queen
herself.</p>

<p>There were a few couples in sight, even then,
coming from or heading toward the gypsy camp.
The boys were glad to see this. It would serve
to keep any of the gypsies from suspecting that
their visit had any particular meaning.</p>

<p>“What do you suppose that crowd is standin’
there for, gapin’ at somethin’ fastened to that tree
yonder?” Lanky asked, as they drew near the spot
where the gay wagons, and the tents of the road
wanderers, could be seen among the trees.</p>

<p>“Looks like they might be reading some notice;
and there are a number of gypsies in the lot, too,”
Frank replied.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“Shucks! I know,” exclaimed the other, suddenly.</p>

<p>“I think I’ve guessed it, too,” Frank went on
to say. “I remember that bill-poster said he had
a few more notices of the meet to stick up; and the
chances are he’s been along here in his buggy.
Pudge Watkins wouldn’t stop because it was Sunday.
You never saw him at church in your life.”</p>

<p>“That’s what!” echoed Lanky. “And looks like
the gyps might be some stuck on that colored show-bill,
too, Frank. Hope they like it well enough to
figure on staying around this section till after the
athletic stunts have been pulled off.”</p>

<p>“Suppose we stop here a bit, and listen to what
they say?” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ll go you on that idea,” replied Lanky. “It
may put us wise about what they mean to do.”</p>

<p>Accordingly the two lads drew in toward the
group that stood in front of the placard tacked to the
tree, where it could be easily seen from the road.
Just as both of them had guessed, it was one of the
posters gotten up by the wide-awake committee of
arrangements, telling in glowing language of the
splendid program that had been made up for the
coming Wednesday afternoon.</p>

<p>Of course the boys had read it many times before.
Indeed, they knew about the whole thing
from beginning to end. And yet, as both their
names occurred among the numerous entries for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
the prizes about to be competed for, it was only
natural that they should be pleased to stand there,
and listen to the various comments.</p>

<p>Some of the gypsy men were curious about the
nature of the affair. Evidently they had never
been given the privilege of witnessing such a tournament;
and feeling a certain amount of interest in
things that pertained to manly sports, they were
even then trying to get additional information by
“pumping” an old farmer, who, with his wife and
three small children, happened to be sitting in a
wagon near by.</p>

<p>As he turned out to be almost as unfamiliar with
the nature of the meet as the road-roamers themselves,
their success was not very flattering. A
couple of very small town boys who had wandered
out that way endeavored to supply the lack of
knowledge, but did not seem to be making much
progress when Frank and Lanky came along.</p>

<p>Some of the gypsy men turned to the new arrivals
with a list of questions, and Lanky was only
too willing to answer to the best of his ability.</p>

<p>“Greatest thing that you ever saw, or will see,
if you live a thousand years,” he went on, in a way
that made Frank smile, thinking that his chum
might get an engagement as a “barker” for some
side show to a circus. “Yes, sir, there will be the
greatest crowd in and around Columbia that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
ever known. You’ll be mighty sorry to miss it, I
tell you. And the farmers who want to trade
horses, they always just flock to these athletic
meets. I reckon anybody could do more business in
that line in two days, than a week at other times.”</p>

<p>Frank saw some of the gypsies look at each other
and nod, as though they rather fancied the idea.
Business with them was already the first consideration.
They may have thought that they had
about exhausted the horse trade around the immediate
vicinity of Columbia; but if farmers for a
radius of twenty miles and more would be in town
with their vehicles on that wonderful occasion, well,
that certainly put another face on the matter.</p>

<p>“It’s working, Lanky,” Frank managed to say
in a low tone to his chum. “Keep it up, and you’ll
get the whole lot to see things your way.”</p>

<p>“Huh! takes your Uncle Lanky to do the grand
chinning act,” muttered the tall boy, proudly. “I
can soft-soap to beat the band, when I want to.
Got ’em started on the right track; and now I’ll
just say a few more words to clinch things.”</p>

<p>Some of the gypsies, after talking between themselves,
started to ask questions; and as these applied
to the actual events that were scheduled to
take place, Frank felt that he could take it upon
himself to answer as well as his comrade.</p>

<p>He described some of the competitions that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
seemed to puzzle the nomads, as shot-putting,
throwing the hammer, hurdle racing, sack racing,
and such things so familiar to all schoolboys in
these days.</p>

<p>The group grew around the two boys. Others
of the campers began to be drawn to the spot, as
the two lads continued to talk and explain things.
Presently even a few of the women wandered that
way; and the children were already clustered in
knots, listening, nodding their black locks, and looking
wise from time to time, as if what was Greek
to their elders might not be so unfamiliar to them.</p>

<p>Lanky was very much in earnest. He did not feel
that the success of the athletic meet depended at
all upon whether the gypsies voted to remain over
a few more days or not; but he did believe that the
carrying out of the plans he and Frank had arranged
would be affected by this decision.</p>

<p>By degrees the men seemed to be impressed with
the brilliant chance that opened up before them for
doing a land-office business in horse trading with
the army of “hoosiers” who Lanky declared would
flock to the meet, many of them remaining over
in town several days to do their summer shopping,
thus killing two birds with one stone.</p>

<p>“I’ve got ’em on the jump, Frank,” he whispered
to his chum, as he saw the group of men excitedly
discussing something that seemed to be of considerable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
importance. “They’re set on stayin’ over,
you see. Looky, there goes a bunch back to camp;
and I’m thinkin’ they’re going to see the queen, to
put the thing up to her. Hope now she listens to
’em, and says stay.”</p>

<p>A few minutes later the same men came hurrying
back.</p>

<p>“No use askin’ what they did, Frank,” remarked
Lanky, exultantly; “just take a peep at their grinning
faces; doesn’t that tell the story?”</p>

<p>“I reckon you’re right, Lanky,” admitted the
other, readily enough.</p>

<p>“That means they stay right here; doesn’t it,
Frank? They’ll be on hand if that telegram only
happens to come along to-morrow, Tuesday or
Wednesday. Hope it gets a hustle on by then. If
it doesn’t, I’ll give the game up as a bad job, and
call myself a poor detective, who couldn’t detect
a clue as big as Squire Perkins’ new barn.”</p>

<p>“Well, the way you ran this little dodge, and
tempted the men to stay over, tells me you’re going
to do better things right soon!” declared Frank.</p>

<p>“Do you really believe that?” demanded the other,
who was always glad to hear Frank praise him.</p>

<p>“I certainly do, Lanky. And what you’ve done
right here is no little job. It gives you the extension
of time you wanted, and holds the gates wide
open.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>“They’re going to stay, Frank!” said Lanky in
a low tone, after listening to what those who had
just come from the camp said to their comrades
still clustered near the tree bearing the flaming
placard. “Three days’ grace, Frank. Isn’t that just
bully for us, though? Sure that telegram must get
here before all that time slips past. Say, our folks
might read us a lecture if they saw us here, blowing
our horns about the grand athletic tournament;
but, Frank, when I just remember what we’re doing
it all for, I don’t feel that it’s wrong. I’d go still
further to help——” but his chum held up a finger,
and gave a significant warning hiss, to cut his impetuous
exclamation short.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>THE GYPSY QUEEN’S MOVE</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Unless</span> you want to queer the whole business,
Lanky, you’ve got to hold yourself in check better,”
Frank said, cautiously, making sure that none of
the gypsy men was close enough to hear him whisper
in this fashion.</p>

<p>“That’s right,” muttered the other, in a penitent
fashion. “I’m always forgettin’ and blurtin’ things
out. And it’s sure lucky for me I’ve got you handy
to put me wise to things. I’ll try and chuck it from
now on, Frank, believe me, I will.”</p>

<p>“Then laugh right now, and don’t look as sober
as if you’d got word your great-grandfather’d died,
and forgot you in his will,” Frank went on to
say, jokingly. “Because I can see someone watching
us from the big wagon of the queen, right now.
I wouldn’t be surprised if she’s spotted us as the
two boys who were in the camp that other time,
and means to keep tabs on us.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’ll be on my guard, I promise you, Frank,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>
Lanky went on to say, with his teeth tightly clenched.
“It’s a shame to upset all our fine work by a mistake
on my part. But do we turn away now; or hang
around the camp a little, to see if we can’t get a
peep at that girl?”</p>

<p>“Might as well stay here a while,” was the reply
his chum made. “It’d look sort of queer if we
pushed along in too big a hurry. What we want
to do is to act natural, and do what any fellow would
be apt to, if he just happened along.”</p>

<p>So they walked over to the camp. Most of
the gypsies had returned by now. After being so
familiar with the two boys, and receiving such important
information from them, they seemed to
look at Frank and Lanky in rather a friendly way.
The boys might wander all about now, and see whatever
they wanted, without being greeted by the usual
black scowls.</p>

<p>“Say, Frank,” remarked Lanky, presently, as they
were watching some of the women hang a black
kettle over a fire by means of a chain, that had a
hook at one end, the other being secured to a stout
iron bar above.</p>

<p>“Well, what is it now?” asked his companion,
without turning his head, as he found himself very
much interested in the operation.</p>

<p>“She’s beckonin’ to us!” Lanky continued, in
a somewhat awed voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>“Who do you mean?” asked Frank, beginning
to take notice.</p>

<p>“The old lady, the queen bee of the hive, you
know,” replied the other.</p>

<p>At that Frank turned his head.</p>

<p>“That’s right, she is,” he remarked; “and we’ll
have to step over that way, Lanky. Now, keep your
wits about you, and don’t give yourself away. Like
as not she only wants to ask us some questions
about the athletic meet.”</p>

<p>They started toward the place where the old
queen sat on a three-legged stool, close to the steps
leading up to the rear of the huge, painted van
that served as her house, as well as means of conveyance
over the roads.</p>

<p>Lanky felt sure he would now find some sort of
opportunity for proving whether his belief about
the little girl could be founded on facts, or imagination.
At the same time he was inwardly resolved
to let Frank do most of the talking, content on
his own part to just “look around.”</p>

<p>“You are the boy who brought me the paper
to sign; am I right?” asked the gypsy queen, as
Frank reached her side.</p>

<p>“Yes, we were here the other day, and brought
that paper,” he replied.</p>

<p>“My men have been telling me much about some
sort of circus that will be in your town this week;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
and they said you could explain what it was?” she
continued, keeping her sharp black eyes fastened
on their faces.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, sure we can,” Lanky spoke up.
“Frank, oblige the lady; I’m talked out.”</p>

<p>So Frank did explain about the rivalries of the
three schools, and how they came together at various
times to find out which could excel in all sorts
of sports such as healthy boys like.</p>

<p>He described these things so well that he really
interested the gypsy woman. She could understand
how boys liked such sports, for the lads of the camp
were always wrestling, boxing, shooting, or fishing,
as the chance arose.</p>

<p>Lanky could not keep his eyes away from the big
wagon. It seemed to him that he heard some sort
of slight movement within the van; and no doubt
he was picturing in his mind the frightened, yet
eager, little girl crouching there, wanting to show
herself to them, yet shrinking from arousing the
anger of the black-eyed old queen.</p>

<p>“Your friend seems to be interested in my new
wagon,” remarked the gypsy, suddenly, and Lanky
started, fearing that he had betrayed a fatal curiosity;
but he drew a breath of relief when she continued,
using language that surprised Frank, as it
told him the woman must have a certain amount
of education: “If you would like, I will be glad<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
to show you how it is arranged inside. It is what
they call the last thing in road wagons. And you
have been kind to tell my people about the chance
of trading horses in the crowd that is coming to
the circus.”</p>

<p>Frank saw her eyes sparkle while she was saying
this. He immediately guessed that she had a very
good reason for talking in that way, though he
could not understand what it might be.</p>

<p>“If you don’t mind,” he remarked, showing a
fair amount of eagerness, “we would like to see
how it is fixed inside. I’ve never really examined
one of these road wagons, and always wanted to.”</p>

<p>“Come inside with me, then, both of you,” continued
the queen, rising from her stool, and starting
up the three steps leading to the closed door.</p>

<p>Frank heard Lanky draw a long breath. He
laid a hand on the other’s arm as they started after
the gypsy woman; and Lanky understood that this
was meant for a warning to him.</p>

<p>“All right, Frank,” he muttered, calming down
again.</p>

<p>When the door of the big van had been opened,
the interior was exposed to view. And the first
thing the two lads discovered was a girl of about
eight or nine years of age, sitting curled up on a
cushion. She had big dark eyes, and hair that was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
almost purplish black. Her skin was as dusky as
that of any of the men.</p>

<p>“This is my grandchild,” explained the old
woman, with something like pride in her voice,
for the girl was decidedly handsome, though very
bold looking. “When I die she will be the queen
after me. It is understood by the tribe. She comes
of royal blood, does Mena.”</p>

<p>Then she began to explain what the many appliances
were for, that they saw in the wagon. The
girl seemed to understand that she had better go
away while the old queen was telling these two
town boys about her new van, for she left the
vehicle.</p>

<p>Lanky followed her with his eyes. Frank could
see a puzzled expression on the face of his chum,
and that he was shaking his head, as though unable
to make out how he had come to mistake a
girl like that for a little thing begging for his assistance.</p>

<p>Evidently Lanky’s ambition had dropped until it
was now very near the zero mark.</p>

<p>Frank was genuinely interested in all the wonderful
arrangements which the new traveling van
had for sleeping, cooking, and even writing; though
a gypsy is not supposed to do much of this last.</p>

<p>He asked numerous questions, just as the men
had done when seeking information concerning the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
coming athletic contests. And the old woman did
not seem at all averse about telling him whatever
he wanted to know.</p>

<p>Frank, however, was not so wrapped up in his
desire to learn facts but what he could use his eyes
to good advantage. And he noticed that several
times while she was thus explaining things, the old
gypsy would shoot a triumphant glance over in
the direction of Lanky.</p>

<p>Apparently she must have guessed something of
the motive that influenced that Columbia High student
to wander out to the camp on this Sunday
afternoon. And no doubt she was chuckling to herself
over her success in hoodwinking Lanky. His
blank face gave her satisfaction, Frank felt sure.
And he believed he knew the reason for it, too.</p>

<p>After spending at least fifteen minutes in the big
van talking with the owner, who seemed much more
intelligent than Frank had ever believed any gypsy
could be, the boys made a move as if to go.</p>

<p>“Will you come again?” she asked, seeming to
direct the query toward Lanky; and that worthy
took it upon himself to reply.</p>

<p>“I hardly think so. You see, we’re in the big
run that winds up the meet, and after school we’ll
have to be practicing, so as to keep in condition.
Besides,” with a sigh, “I guess we’ve seen <i>everything</i>
now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>Lanky was plainly much disheartened as he started
to leave the gypsy camp. He even failed to answer
the parting remarks from several of the men, who
seemed to rather look upon the two boys in the light
of friends, after receiving so much information that
promised to be valuable to them as horse traders.
And so Frank had to wave a good-bye for both of
them.</p>

<p>They walked down the road side by side, heading
toward the town. Lanky appeared to be wrapped
up in his gloomy thoughts, and presently Frank
gave him a sly punch in the ribs, bringing out a
grunt.</p>

<p>“What ails you, old chum?” demanded Frank, in
a joking tone. “You pull a long enough face to
stand for seven first-class funerals.”</p>

<p>“It’s all off, Frank!” grumbled the other.</p>

<p>“Oh! you mean the little racket you were working;
is that what makes you look so sad?” demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>“I was foolish and that’s the trouble!” said Lanky
savagely.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t like to dispute a gentleman’s word,
when he’s bent on giving an opinion of himself; but
I’d like to know why you say that?” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“To think that I’d mistake that half-grown gypsy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
girl for a little one has me badgered some, I tell
you, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps after all, Lanky, you didn’t make such
a big mistake as you think!”</p>

<p>“What’s that you’re giving me, Frank; not taffy,
I hope?” cried the tall boy, as he whirled around
on his companion, eagerly.</p>

<p>“There may have been a small child in that wagon,
Lanky, when we first came near the gypsy camp.
I didn’t tell you before; but the fact is, I sure saw
the old woman hustle some little figure, bundled in
a red shawl, down those three steps, and then another
gypsy woman lead her off into the woods!”</p>

<p>“Oh! Frank, is that so?” burst from the delighted
Lanky, his eyes sparkling once more with renewed
interest. “You saw all that, did you, when we were
talking with the gypsy men? Aren’t you the swift
bunch, though, to get on to everything, while I
stand around with my mouth open, but my eyes
stuck fast? Then she sent the little girl away, and
asked us to take a look around in her wagon just
to pull the wool over my eyes? And, Frank, she’d
’a’ done it for me, right up to the notch, only for
you being so smart!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVIII<br>

<small>FINDING OUT</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Lanky</span> was once more himself. The look of
gloom had vanished from his thin face, and he
turned an eager glance on his comrade.</p>

<p>“I’ve been thinking,” Frank went on, slowly, as
he sometimes did when he was trying to grasp an
idea, “that we ought to do something to settle this
business about whether there really is a little child
in the charge of the old queen, or not.”</p>

<p>“Hear! hear!” burst out the other, pretending
to clap his hands.</p>

<p>“If it turns out that there isn’t any such thing
as the child you believed tried to attract your attention,
then the sooner we give up all this foolishness,
why, the better; you understand, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“But if there <i>is</i> such a little girlie, Frank?”</p>

<p>“We’ll stay in the game, make sure of that,” replied
the other, in a determined tone that told Lanky
what he might expect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>“Oh! I agree with you all right, about that,
Frank,” he observed; “but the question is, how
under the sun can we do it? That sly old queen
knows how to slip the child away every time we
happen to be seen coming around the camp.”</p>

<p>“Well, we must make out <i>not</i> to be seen, then,
next time,” was the matter-of-fact way Frank put
it.</p>

<p>“Do you mean we’ll sneak back, and see what’s
goin’ on, right now; sorter creep up through the
bushes, Injun fashion, and peep, unbeknown to any
of the gypsies? Tell me, is that what’s got you,
Frank?”</p>

<p>“Well no, hardly that, Lanky,” replied the other.
“In the first place it’s getting kind of late, and I
promised to be home by five, sharp. Then, though
perhaps you haven’t noticed it, there’s a gypsy boy
trailing us right now. No, don’t turn around and
look, because that would tell him we knew all about
his following us. Wait till we get to that bend, and
then you can see without showing that you’re bothering
your head about him.”</p>

<p>“Wow! that’s what I call going some, Frank,”
remarked Lanky, presently.</p>

<p>“You saw him then; didn’t you?” asked the leader
of the boys.</p>

<p>“Right you are; and he’s certain sure follerin’
us, to see that we don’t play a double game, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
sneak back in the direction of the camp,” was
Lanky’s admission.</p>

<p>“And you can understand that a boy wouldn’t
be up to any such trick unless some other person
had told him to do it?” Frank continued, with convincing
force.</p>

<p>“That must mean she did it,” Lanky admitted.</p>

<p>“The old queen, and no other. So, you see, we
couldn’t turn back now without her knowing about
it; and that would give the alarm. Why, by to-morrow
morning these same gypsies would be miles
away on the road to nowhere; and it’d be the hardest
kind of business getting on the track of them
again.”</p>

<p>“Well, when <i>can</i> we come back?” asked Lanky;
“to-morrow afternoon?”</p>

<p>“For one, I don’t feel like waiting that long,” the
other declared.</p>

<p>“Say, could we try it to-night, Frank?” asked
Lanky, eagerly.</p>

<p>“I’m willing to come,” replied his companion;
“if your folks will let you out. Look over here
to the right, and you’ll see a little rise of ground.
And, Lanky, if a fellow sat on top of that, with a
pair of field glasses in his hands, what would hinder
him from seeing everything that happened in the
camp?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>“There’s a clear line between, as sure as anything,”
admitted the other.</p>

<p>“And if they have their fires going, as they generally
do in the early evening, why, the glass would
work O. K. I’ve looked through it at the moon,
and Jupiter, Venus and that crowd of worlds in
the night sky. Is it a go, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“Put her there, Frank,” replied Lanky, thrusting
out a hand with a boy’s impetuosity. “Why, I’d
back you up, no matter what sort of a harum-scarum
scheme you gave me. But this isn’t anything like
that; I consider that it’s the boss idea. Why, we can
crawl up there and just watch for keeps, without
a single gyp bein’ any the wiser. Call it a go,
Frank!”</p>

<p>“Then that’s settled, and I’ll meet you at the big
elm at, say, seven,” Frank proposed. “It doesn’t
get real dark till after eight nowadays, you know;
and we’ll have plenty of time to wander up this
road.”</p>

<p>Lanky was greatly pleased over the new development.
Coming on the tail of his recent gloom, it
was all the more acceptable to him. When he later
on parted company with his chum, his last words
were:</p>

<p>“Don’t fail to be there at seven sharp, Frank!
It’d knock me into flinders if you didn’t show up.
I’d be tempted to come alone, and make the try,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
though chances are I’d only turn it into a foozle by
my clumsiness.”</p>

<p>“You can depend on me,” was what the other
said, positively.</p>

<p>Frank would have liked to take his father fully
into his confidence, and get his sanction for the
strange little errand that was about to occupy the
time of himself and Lanky that night. But it happened
that Mr. Allen had stayed at the house of a
friend whom he had been visiting that afternoon;
and Frank’s mother was lying down, with a headache;
so it seemed that even had he wanted to, he
could not have taken either of his parents into his
secret just then.</p>

<p>A little before seven he went out, without anyone
paying any particular attention to his action.
Possibly the mother supposed Frank was going
to church, for he and Lanky both sang in the volunteer
choir.</p>

<p>But the boy really believed he had good reasons
for absenting himself from his regular seat in the
organ loft that night. And under his coat he carried
the field glasses which he had spoken of to
his chum.</p>

<p>Lanky was waiting for him, and kicking his heels
against the base of the big tree that had been appointed
as a place of meeting.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>“Gee! aren’t you late, Frank?” he asked, a little
pettishly.</p>

<p>Just then the church clock boomed out the hour
of seven, as if saving Frank the trouble of making
a reply.</p>

<p>“I reckon I’ve been here half an hour, and countin’
the minutes,” admitted Lanky, candidly, as they
started off on a brisk walk.</p>

<p>Evening was just coming on, and there were
some clouds covering the heavens as the sun went
down, which gave Lanky new cause for anxiety.
He would not be happy a single day if things went
too smoothly.</p>

<p>“Reckon now there’s a storm just wantin’ to sail
along this way, to upset all our calculations about
Wednesday,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“Oh! I guess not,” Frank tried to console him by
saying; “weather reports say dry weather and
warmer for the whole eastern half of the country
for the first three days of the week, beginning to-morrow.
I looked it up this morning. Forget
it, and let’s think only of what we’re trying to do
right now.”</p>

<p>When they saw anyone approaching they stepped
into the nearby woods, and let the other pass by.
Perhaps this looked a little suspicious, but then
Frank was afraid that one of the gypsy men might
happen that way, and hurry back with a report that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
was apt to create some little excitement in the
queen’s van.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we gettin’ pretty near that little rise,
Frank?” asked Lanky, when they had been making
progress for some time.</p>

<p>“Be there in five minutes or so,” was the confident
reply; for Frank had the happy faculty of
taking note of distances, by objects to be seen along
the way; and as a rule he was able to tell to a fraction
just where he was, when going over a route he
had traversed before.</p>

<p>He turned out to be a true prophet, too; for about
the time that limit had expired Lanky remarked in
a thrilling whisper:</p>

<p>“I can see the rise right now, Frank; we’d better
turn off the road, too, because there’s somebody coming
with a rig. It might be one of those jockeys
from the camp.”</p>

<p>Frank hastened to comply with the suggestion,
and they were soon making their way through the
woods that led up to the bare mound, which the
boys had selected as a place for making their observation.</p>

<p>They crept along with extreme caution, because
the camp was not far off, and both of them feared
lest a gypsy man might be wandering around about
that time, and would discover them unless they used
unusual care.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>Presently they ascended the little rise.</p>

<p>“Say, this is a good place to see from, all right,”
commented Lanky.</p>

<p>Frank, instead of replying, was starting to focus
the field glasses on the camp of the nomads, plainly
seen through the open lane. Although night had by
this time fallen fully, several fires were burning in
the camp, and these lighted up the entire place
where the wagons and tents were.</p>

<p>The gypsies were either moving about, or else
sitting near the fires, evidently eating their supper.
Lanky almost held his breath while Frank looked.</p>

<p>“See anything of her?” he asked, finally, unable
to hold out longer.</p>

<p>“Take a chance, and see for yourself,” was the
reply, as the glasses were thrust into his hands; and
there was a note of satisfaction in Frank’s voice that
gave the other a thrill.</p>

<p>He quickly held the ends of the twin tubes to his
eyes, and ten seconds later Frank heard him chuckle,
as though greatly pleased.</p>

<p>“She’s there, Frank, sure as you’re born!”
Lanky ejaculated.</p>

<p>“Softly, now, old fellow,” warned Frank.</p>

<p>“You saw her; of course you did, Frank?” continued
the tall boy, quivering with delight. “She’s
eating beside that girl we met—Mena, the queen
called her. There, the old woman is scolding her,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
Frank! I can see her shaking a finger at the child,
and I believe the little thing’s crying, too.”</p>

<p>“What happened?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“The old queen leaned over and slapped the little
thing twice right on her ear. She’s pointin’ up at
the wagon right now; and, yes, siree, the girl climbs
in, as if she was afraid to stay outside any longer.
Frank, that settles it; doesn’t it? The girl is there,
we know that now; don’t we?”</p>

<p>For answer Frank clutched his chum’s groping
hand, and squeezed it.</p>

<p>“And we keep right along in the game, waitin’
to hear from Mr. Elverson; don’t we, Frank?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we do; and I’m hoping that it
comes out just as you’re expecting, Lanky, because
you sure have got yourself keyed up to top-notch
speed right now. But perhaps we’d better be getting
back to town. If we hurried, we might reach
there by eight, and lend a hand at that anthem in
the choir.”</p>

<p>“Oh! I’m willing, all right, Frank,” declared the
now light-hearted Lanky; “we just hit the right
nail on the head when we came out here, and spied
on that camp. Poor little thing! Say, that old
woman’s got a temper, all right; and I reckon that
child ought to be taken away from her, even if she
doesn’t prove to be the long-lost Effie Elverson.
Come on, Frank, let’s run a little along the road.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIX<br>

<small>THE GREAT DAY</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was Wednesday at last.</p>

<p>Time had dragged fearfully to all the young people
in Columbia; and doubtless the same could be
said of Clifford and Bellport, during those last two
days of school.</p>

<p>The annual examinations would soon be coming
on, so that it was just as well that the great athletic
meet should be carried through before this period
of stress.</p>

<p>And it was a glorious day, too, with a clear sky,
and not too hot for the strenuous work which those
young athletes expected to engage in.</p>

<p>All morning vehicles kept coming into the town
of Columbia, some of them from great distances,
and containing entire families. The former meetings
of the three rival schools in various contests
had resulted in such thrilling scenes that their fame
had gone far afield; consequently farmers hitched<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
up, and gave the entire day to merry-making with
their families.</p>

<p>As afternoon came along the crowds began to
flock out along the road leading to the field where
Columbia always held these events. As has been
stated before, this was about a mile from town, and
somewhat down the river, the trolley from Bellport,
which was being extended to Clifford at the
time, leaving loads of eager spectators at a point
near the grounds.</p>

<p>An hour before the time set for the start of the
exercises it seemed as though every seat in the
grand-stand was taken; and even the bleachers had
overflowed into the field. Apparently the day
would see such a throng as Columbia had never before
drawn together in all her history.</p>

<p>Young athletes were as plentiful as blackberries in
August. They could be seen here, there, and everywhere;
some exercising to keep in trim for the
coming of the event in which they expected to take
part; others conferring with the coach, or chatting
with groups of admiring friends.</p>

<p>It was a poor contestant who did not have at least
a few devoted adherents, who declared it to be
their honest opinion that he was bound to make
all the others in the same event “look like thirty
cents,” as they were fond of putting it.</p>

<p>Lanky was the center of a great deal of attention.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
After his phenomenal run of the trial day,
he was looked upon as the one best hope of Columbia
in the long race, which some of the boys called
a Marathon, though it could be hardly classed under
that head.</p>

<p>Of course they still had faith in Frank Allen and
Bones Shadduck, either one of whom they believed
could win in case any unlucky accident happened
that would cripple the long-legged racer, who looked
like a greyhound as he stepped so lightly around
among his fellow students.</p>

<p>Clifford and Bellport had their legions present.
They seemed to mass together as a rule, so that they
might make the most noise, and thus encourage
their respective candidates for high honors.</p>

<p>The noise began to be deafening, what with boys
yelling; horns tooting; girls singing their class
songs; and automobiles honking merrily, as they
came in shoals, to leave their passengers or secure
positions where the latter could sit still, and see
all that was going on.</p>

<p>Chief Hogg was there, and looking spick and span
in a new uniform, with his silver shield glittering
as splendidly as a newly polished decoration could
appear. He had his assistants all in line; and in
addition there were a dozen deputy sheriffs sworn
in for the occasion by the high official who graced
the meet with his presence.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>Once upon a time there had been nearly a riot
come about at one of these athletic affairs, caused
by some turbulent spirits; and the committee in
charge had determined to leave no stone unturned
on this occasion to prevent a recurrence of that sad
event, when several heads were broken by flying
stones.</p>

<p>Roderick Seymour, who was said to have been
the best leader Columbia ever had, was taking charge
of things on this particular day, having come home
from the city, where he was in business, especially
to see Columbia boys once more show their mettle,
and to hear again that slogan:</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! hi! hi! hi! <i>veni! vidi! vici!</i> we
came, we saw, we conquered! Columbia! Rah!”</p>

<p>Ah! how it must have thrilled that graduate, as
he listened again to it pealing from the throats of
the score or two of boys whom the cheer captain,
Herman Hooker, was leading in the concerted
shout! What memories it must have awakened in
the mind of Roderick Seymour, who during his four
years in the school had always held the respect of
every boy worth knowing, as a lover of clean sport,
and of a square deal. It was surely worth coming
two hundred miles just to see such inspiring sights,
and listen to that battle cry of Columbia as she
again faced her bitter rivals of Bellport and Clifford,
always eager to make her athletes take their dust.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>“Hello! Frank!” was the way Lanky greeted his
chum, whom he had not seen that day up to the
minute they met.</p>

<p>“You’re feeling pretty perky, I reckon, Lanky,”
remarked the other, smiling as he saw the look of
confidence upon the thin face of the tall runner.</p>

<p>“Never felt better in my life, Frank; and if I
fall down to-day I ought to quit trying the long-distance
act. But, Frank, if you happen to run across
a messenger boy who looks like he was huntin’
somebody, just remember me; won’t you?”</p>

<p>“What’s up?” questioned Frank, laughing at the
earnest air of his friend.</p>

<p>“Why, you see, I just got a hunch that there
might a telegram come for me while the meet was
takin’ place,” Lanky explained; “and so I told Conrad
at the station that if so be anything came buzzing
along the wires, meant for Lanky Wallace, he
ought to send a messenger down here on the jump
with it.”</p>

<p>“And did he promise he would?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Huh! he just had to,” grunted Lanky. “Why,
right now there isn’t a feller in all Columbia that’d
dare deny me anything I wanted. Conrad said he’s
bound to do it, because he’s been and heard that like
as not I’m goin’ to be the one that’ll win the long-distance
run; and somehow they all think that, Frank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
just because I had that little spurt the other day, you
know.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank, impressively, “just you see
that you have another of the same kind to-day; and
make those people from Bellport and Clifford take
notice. They’ve made a lot of changes in their
runners from last season, and think they’ve got it
in for poor old Columbia. That’s the way they
talk, Lanky; but some of the boys were here to see
you come in Saturday, and <i>they</i> know better.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I hear that Coddling, their old pitcher in
Bellport, has blossomed out something in the
phenom class as a long-distance runner; and I guess,
Frank, that we’ll have to keep an eye on that tricky
old scout more’n anybody else.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of that. There’s a new fellow
up in Clifford that they say never gets tired, and
can come in from a ten-mile skip without hardly
a hair turned. That may be just talk, or as you
say, hot air; but, Lanky, don’t be over-confident.
It’s all well enough to be <i>sure</i> you can win; but
never let up in your pace because you think you’ve
got the thing cinched. A swift runner may dash
past you in a second, and after that it’s up to you
to get him! because he sets the pace, not you.”</p>

<p>“Frank, it’s mighty good of you giving me these
pointers, and you going to be a runner in the long
race, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>“Oh! whether I win, or you, or Bones, makes
little difference to me, so long as the Columbia
purple and gold crosses the line first. That’s what
we call school loyalty, you know, Lanky. Of course
it’s always fine to be the one to get all the cheer,
but first of all the school! But there goes the head
man of the committee climbing the band stand. The
music’s stopped, so I reckon the games are going to
begin pretty quick now.”</p>

<p>After the great throng could be quieted down, the
heavy voice of the gentleman who had agreed to
serve as the head of the arrangements committee
started to address the thousands gathered in that
field devoted to boys’ sports.</p>

<p>As briefly as possible he explained what clean
athletic games would do for the maintenance of
health in the bodies of those engaging in them up
to a reasonable limit; and also what grand times the
three schools had had in the past. He congratulated
the people of the towns lying along the Harrapin
that there had been so little unpleasant friction
in the past; and expressed the hope that the
present meeting of their representative young athletes
would further cement the bonds of good fellowship
among the boys of Columbia, Clifford and
Bellport.</p>

<p>After the hearty cheers had subsided he started
again to tell of the various contests that had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
arranged, as well as to mention a list of prizes
donated by the leading merchants of the three places,
and which would be awarded to the winners in the
numerous events.</p>

<p>Then the first contest was called, and immediately
everybody in that great throng became intensely interested.</p>

<p>It was a fifty-yard dash; and there were just nine
contestants; since the limit had been placed at three
for each school.</p>

<p>In this tournament it had been wisely decided
to let each contest stand on its own merits. There
were just seventeen events, and as each would
count just one point, the school winning a plurality
of these prizes would be adjudged the grand champion
for the season in track and field athletics.</p>

<p>In this way even the absurd sack race would count
just as much as the ten-mile run. But what was
fair for one was fair for all, and there was no
grumbling because of these arrangements.</p>

<p>As their event was scheduled to come off at the
very last of the meet, Frank and Larry could take
things easy, while waiting for the time to arrive
when the long-distance race would be called.</p>

<p>“Have you noticed that quite a lot of our dark-faced
friends of the gypsy camp are present?”
Lanky asked his chum, as they stood waiting for
the crack of the pistol which would send the sprinters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
on their furious rush over the short distance
that had been marked out for them.</p>

<p>“Yes, and I saw a couple talking with a farmer,”
replied Frank, laughing. “Guess they’ve got a
dicker on with him, from the way they acted. Say,
they’ll be glad they took your advice, and held over
here. Perhaps they’ll do the biggest day’s business
ever. Look at that Clifford football snapback, will
you? They say he’s winged lightning on the short
dash; and I want to see if it’s so.”</p>

<p>“Well, the referee is gettin’ ready to send the
bunch off, so keep your good eye peeled on him then;
because if he can go that fast, we might lose sight
of him altogether. Wow! they’re off, Frank!
That was a great start, I tell you!”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XX<br>

<small>CLIFFORD’S NEW HOPE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> before some of the crowd knew it had
begun, the fifty-yard dash was over. Coddling had
won!</p>

<p>“White Wings just flew the coop, and landed the
first prize!” whooped a wild Clifford enthusiast,
as he jumped up and down in his excitement.</p>

<p>“And we’ve got a few surprises like Coddling
up our sleeve, Columbia!” cried a second proud
student, who wore the colors of the down-river
school.</p>

<p>“He did carry it off, sure as anything!” remarked
Lanky, feeling a little discouraged. “And
I thought our man, Paul Bird, had a sure thing.”</p>

<p>“Paul entered in the wrong class there,” remarked
Frank. “Just wait till you see him run in the hundred-yard
race, and the quarter-mile. They’ve got
them so scattered that he can rest up good, between
each one. Didn’t you notice that while the
Clifford fellow went like the wind at first, Paul was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
cutting down his lead in great shape when they
crossed the line?”</p>

<p>“That’s a fact, Frank,” admitted Lanky.</p>

<p>“If that race had been twice as far, Paul would
have had him easily beaten. Well, let Clifford roar
all she wants, right now; perhaps the poor thing
won’t have another chance to whoop it up all day.”</p>

<p>“She generally does get it in the neck, somehow,
before the end comes,” admitted Lanky. “There
never was such luck, the Clifford boys say. But,
all the same, Frank, they are talking loud about
what they’re going to do to us in that long run.”</p>

<p>“They’re welcome to say what they please,” the
other remarked, calmly. “Talk is cheap, and boasting
hurts no one but those who carry it to excess.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating thereof.
We’ll talk less, and <i>do</i> something, Lanky.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff, fellows!” cried a Columbia boy
who happened to be passing, and caught the last few
words of what Frank said.</p>

<p>“There comes the new Clifford runner, who’s
going to make us look like thirty cents, they say.
What’s his name, Frank; did you notice it on the
program?” Lanky asked.</p>

<p>“Larry Parker,” Frank replied; “and I rather
think he’s coming right over now to take a look
at the three Columbia fellows who will be against
him in that race. Of course he’s heard a heap about<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
your doings on Saturday; and he means to size you
up. We’ll have to be agreeable to him, remember,
Lanky. This is our ground, and to-day Clifford and
Bellport are our guests.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” muttered the tall lad, eyeing the approaching
runner; who had a large “C” on his sleeveless
shirt to indicate to which school he belonged,
just as if the colors he sported would not do that.</p>

<p>Evidently Larry Parker was somewhat of a
breezy sort, for he came up to the two Columbia
boys, whom he had never met before, and extended
his hand.</p>

<p>“Hello! fellows!” he exclaimed. “I’m told that
this is Frank Allen, and Lanky Wallace, two of Columbia’s
star long-distance runners. And as I’m
entered in that little jaunt myself this afternoon,
with a few foolish Clifford boys thinking I’ve got
a fighting chance to win, thought I’d like to know
you a little, before I see the last of you over my
shoulder.”</p>

<p>There was a cool assurance about the fellow that
impressed Frank against him. It was not that he
felt the utmost confidence in himself, for that is no
crime; but he acted as though treating the others
with disdain.</p>

<p>Frank did not like the face he saw. There was
a sly, crafty expression on it, he believed. To his
mind, then, this new Clifford hope, Larry Parker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
would not hesitate about descending to trickery, if
by means of it he might increase his chances for
winning his race. The means did not count in such
a fellow’s mind, only what lay at the end. And in
this case the handsome prize offered was a gold
watch, surely worth exerting one’s very best powers
in the hope of winning.</p>

<p>Another thing Frank noticed, for he was quick
to discover little items that might stand for a great
deal.</p>

<p>“Um! a cigarette smoker, eh?” was what he said
to himself, as he saw that the first and second fingers
of the other’s hand were stained yellow; and Frank
knew just what that meant. “Chances are, that if
he’s a good runner now, he won’t be a year from to-day.
And I’d like to wager a good deal that he falls
down in the last part of this ten-mile race. So
this is the chap who never turns a hair after he’s
clipped off his cool ten, is it? I guess he won’t win
against a clean fellow like Lanky, with no bad habits
to weaken him for the strain.”</p>

<p>Frank knew that Larry Parker had only come
across from the Clifford benches to size them up at
close quarters. He was doubtless trying to discover
some signs of weakness about them. Besides,
it might pay him to know two of the contestants
before the race was called.</p>

<p>He stood there, and chatted for a little while,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
laughing at some of the accidents that accompanied
the next few events. One fellow from Bellport, who
tried to beat Jack Comfort’s throw of the weight,
forgot to let go; and was whirled around like a
teetotum, or a dancing dervish as seen over in Northern
Africa. They took him off the field with a dislocated
shoulder, so that he needed the attention of
a doctor.</p>

<p>Frank did not like the way Larry Parker seemed
to enjoy a thing like this. On his part he felt
genuinely sorry for the poor chap; but the Clifford
newcomer looked on it as extremely funny.</p>

<p>Watching his hands after this, Frank noticed that
they seemed to tremble constantly, which was a
rather strange thing in a mere lad.</p>

<p>“That’s what they say excessive cigarette smoking
will do for a fellow, Lanky,” he managed to
whisper in the ear of his chum a little later on; for
be it told, Lanky at several times had been known
to indulge in a smoke of the “coffin nail,” as he
scoffingly called it. “Watch his hands, and see them
flutter. It acts on his heart. If he keeps it up, a
year from now he’ll never be able to run at all.”</p>

<p>Lanky gave a grunt, and turned a little red; but
immediately looked away. It was apparently more
satisfactory to turn his eyes toward that corner of
the stand where a certain little rosy-cheeked girl
sat, waving her Columbia flag every time he looked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
that way. And doubtless the sight of Dora Baxter
inspired Lanky with more and more determination
to do himself proud on this day.</p>

<p>Presently the wiry-looking Clifford athlete betook
himself off, apparently satisfied with his view
of his two rivals at close quarters.</p>

<p>“What do you think of him, Frank?” asked
Lanky. “Is he the great wonder they say, and do
we need to fear him?”</p>

<p>“He’s got all the points of a good runner in his
make-up,” replied Frank. “To tell the truth, he
makes me think of some of the Indian long-distance
runners whose pictures I’ve got at home—Longboat
in particular. Yes, if that fellow let tobacco alone,
and paid attention to himself, I rather think he’d
look at the bunch of us over his shoulder as he led
the procession all along the ten miles.”</p>

<p>“But he does use cigarettes; I saw his stained
fingers,” Lanky went on; “and do you expect that
is going to hurt his chances?”</p>

<p>“I don’t doubt it any more than I doubt my eyes
when I see you in front of me,” Frank went on,
earnestly. “And another thing, Lanky, I must say
I don’t admire his face very much.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter with it, Frank? Now,
all things considered, I was sayin’ to myself that he’s
a heap handsomer than Lanky Wallace ever can be.”</p>

<p>“Oh! well, we’re not talking about good looks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>
now, you know,” laughed Frank. “Anybody could
take just one glance at your face, and know that
he’d be able to trust you to the limit. But, Lanky,
there was something that I think bordered on treachery
and cunning in his shifty eyes, and the sneer
on his face.”</p>

<p>“Whew! that’s layin’ it on pretty thick, Frank!”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think of saying it to a living soul,
only you; and I do it now because I honestly believe
that fellow would be mean enough to do something
to disable you, if he saw that you were going
to pass him, and no one seemed to be looking. He
would stick out his foot, and trip you, hoping you’d
strain an ankle in the tumble, and have to give up.”</p>

<p>“Great governor! you don’t say so, Frank!”
ejaculated Lanky; “but he might know I’d tell it on
him after I did limp in!”</p>

<p>“And he’d claim that it was entirely unintentional
on his part—that he slipped, and came near falling
himself, when he tripped you. All I want to remark
is this, Lanky; keep your eye on him, and look out
for a trick, if you do start to go ahead of him. That
fellow believes in the rule or ruin policy, if ever it
was written on a boy’s face. But see, here comes
the sack race; it ought to be funny enough to
make us forget all our troubles.”</p>

<p>The crowd was in a mood for something comical;
and if sack races are properly conducted, they afford<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>
plenty of fun; except for some of the unfortunate
participants who in falling manage to skin their
noses.</p>

<p>As the sacks had been secured from a regular
sporting goods house in the city they were made substantially,
and doubly reinforced at the bottom. Being
tied around the necks of the contestants there
was no possible way in which they could make use
of their arms in order to block a stumble, or save
themselves in the event of a fall.</p>

<p>At the signal they all started hopping or wriggling
along in such manner as each bagged contestant
thought would best advance his interests. And soon
the vast crowd was shrieking with laughter to see
the comical sight, as each lad made the most desperate
efforts to get ahead.</p>

<p>“Almost down to the last event, Lanky,” said
Bones Shadduck, an hour later, crossing over to
where a number of the Columbia boys stood clustered
around Frank and the tall boy.</p>

<p>“If Bellport takes this pole vault, as I’m afraid
she will,” declared Buster Billings, dejectedly, “the
score will stand a tie between Columbia and Bellport,
with seven wins apiece, and two for Clifford.
That means you’ve just <i>got</i> to come in ahead of the
Bellport runners, Lanky, Frank or Bones. Oh!
please get wings on your feet, and don’t let those
Bellport crowds go through Columbia this afternoon,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
shouting and howling like crazy Indians, because
they’ve licked us at last!”</p>

<p>“Well, here goes the pole vaulting contest,” remarked
another Columbia student; “and Captain
Lee looks fit to jump over a two-story house. He’s
bound to beat our man, Ginger Harper, hand over
fist.”</p>

<p>His words turned out to be the truth, for Cuthbert
Lee easily beat the best record that either of his
contestants could hang up. This made the excitement
intense; for as the nine long-distance runners
came slowly to the scratch, everybody realized that
the score was tied between Bellport and Columbia,
just as it used to be in a tight baseball game. And
if one of their entries won this last match, the long
run, it would mean victory for his school!</p>

<p>And knowing this, the runners themselves were
nerved to do their level best when they drew up in
a line, and began to get ready to jump at the crack
of the pistol.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>WHAT HAPPENED TO BONES</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Crack!</span></p>

<p>It seemed to the mass of spectators, craning their
necks to see what took place, as though that whole
line of lithe runners sprang forward as one.</p>

<p>Every fellow doubtless had his favorite way of
waiting for the signal; though a quick start is of
far less importance in a long run of ten miles than
when the race is a short dash. Some crouched in
all sorts of weird attitudes, doubtless assumed for
effect; but several simply stood with the body bent
for the plunge.</p>

<p>“They’re off!” shrieked hundreds of voices, as the
nine boys were seen to speed away like the wind.</p>

<p>Eager eyes followed their every move, for everything
depended on the result of this race; that is,
with Bellport and Columbia. If Clifford won, why
the other two schools would of course be simply tied
for honors; and must have another test at some later
date. This would be a bad thing all around, since<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>
the tension under which the pupils would continue
to labor must affect their ability to pass the annual
examinations with credit.</p>

<p>Many became anxious because the new wonder
from Clifford, Larry Parker, had shot into the lead,
and seemed capable of increasing the distance between
himself and his competitors at will.</p>

<p>“It’s a walkaway!” whooped the Clifford boys;
for if they could only pull off the most important
event of the great day, that victory would go far
toward healing the wounds caused by the poor showing
of their athletes in other contests.</p>

<p>But very few Columbia fellows were anxious at
this early stage in the race. They knew only too
well that ten miles was a long distance to cover, and
all sorts of things could happen before the goal was
in sight.</p>

<p>“Frank and Lanky and Bones make a team that is
simply unbeatable!” they continued to say, one to
another, as the last of the nine runners vanished from
view up the road in the distance.</p>

<p>“Yes,” others would add, “don’t we know the
tactics of Frank Allen to a dot? You never would
catch him letting himself out in the start of a grilling
ten-mile run, like that new fellow does. He works
up to it by degrees, and the result is at the last
quarter he feels fresh, while the sprinter is all in.
And the other fellows have been ordered to do the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>
same as Frank. Just wait! The one that shouts
last, shouts loudest. We’re holding our wind for
the end!”</p>

<p>As time would hang heavy while the runners were
away, and in order to amuse the great crowd, the
management had arranged to have several spirited
contests for additional prizes. But although these
were full of go and spirit, and evoked considerable
enthusiasm when decided, it was plain that the
throng thought only of the runners coursing over
the country roads, and who in good time would
begin to show up.</p>

<p>The course was in the form of a great loop, though
both the start and the wind-up of the race followed
a single track for half a mile. And when the returning
runners struck this neck of the bottle on the
return trip, the discharge of a small cannon would
announce that the home stretch had been entered,
when everyone was supposed to exert himself to the
limit of endurance.</p>

<p>But as our interest lies almost entirely with the
runners, it is only right that we should follow them
in their long race.</p>

<p>Frank and Lanky had managed to keep pretty
well together during the first few miles. Their position
was something like midway; for while there
were several of the contestants ahead of them, others
were in the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>Bones had been unable to restrain his eagerness,
and chased after the two leaders—Parker for Clifford,
and Coddling for Bellport. Just back of the
other two Columbia entries ran Wentworth, that
sturdy Clifford fellow, who had always worked so
hard on diamond and gridiron for the honor of his
school. Then, not far back of him came Mallory and
Keating, two new Bellport “wonders,” who failed in
the pinch to get even a showing. Far in the rear
trailed Atkins, the third Clifford contestant, who
seemed either gone “stale” from overtraining, or else
was having trouble with his shoes, for he had
stopped twice to do something.</p>

<p>That was the way the runners were spread out
when the three-mile mark was passed. Now and
then Frank could catch a glimpse of those who were
ahead. He wanted to make sure Parker did not gain
such a tremendous lead that he could not be overhauled
later on.</p>

<p>Lanky was fretting some, as usual. He seemed
like a mettlesome horse chafing because of the restraining
bit.</p>

<p>“Frank, say the word, and let’s pick up a bit!” he
complained.</p>

<p>“Just a little, then,” was the reply the other made.</p>

<p>The fewer words that passed between them the
better, for breath was valuable. And it was more
to quiet Lanky than because he believed there was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
as yet any need of shortening the distance between
the leaders and themselves, that Frank gave in so
readily.</p>

<p>Two of the racers seemed to be running neck and
neck. They bore the Clifford and Columbia colors,
which would indicate that Bones must have made
a grand spurt, and overtaken the leader. Perhaps
he would not rest content with that, but try to pass
Larry Parker before the five-mile mark had been
reached.</p>

<p>Already the pace had become so grinding that several
at the tail-end of the procession had dropped
out. Atkins had given up, and Keating was seen
wobbling when a stretch of straight road allowed
Frank to look back. The other fellows were still
booming steadily along, grimly hoping that if they
kept within striking distance, fortune might favor
them by some accident to the leaders, when they
might jump in and win.</p>

<p>All at once, as Frank, side by side with tall Lanky,
broke around a bend of the road, they discovered a
lone figure seated by the wayside, and evidently
nursing a sprained ankle.</p>

<p>Frank saw with more or less dismay that the figure
wore the well-known Columbia colors. He knew to
a certainty then that it must be their chum, Bones
Shadduck, who had met with an accident.</p>

<p>And it was perhaps not strange that just then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
Frank should remember what he had said to Lanky
as a warning, with regard to Larry Parker, in case
he ever found himself in a position to pass the new
Clifford wonder.</p>

<p>“It’s Bones!” Frank snapped out between his
teeth; for it is no easy thing for a fellow who has
been running speedily over four miles to talk while
continuing to rush on.</p>

<p>“Oh! poor old Bones, he’s in the soup!” grunted
Lanky; and it could be seen that he was genuinely
sorry to know the third Columbia contestant had
been thrown out of the race by an accident.</p>

<p>“Looks like he’d sprained his ankle!” remarked
Frank, as they bore down on the spot where Bones
sat, hugging his left leg with both hands.</p>

<p>He looked up as they approached. The expression
of intense pain on his face gave way momentarily
to one of concern. It was the school spirit
conquering mere physical distress.</p>

<p>He made quick motions with his hand, at the same
time shouting ere they had gained a point abreast
of where he lay:</p>

<p>“Go on! Don’t you dare stop a second for me!
I’m all right! Sprained my ankle in the queerest
way ever, just when I was passing Parker. Stone
must have rolled out from under his foot, and right
in my way! It made me stumble, and down I came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
ker-flop! Go on! Beat ’em both out! You can do
it! Columbia forever! Oh!”</p>

<p>The last was an exclamation of acute pain. Evidently
the patriotic Bones, in endeavoring to wave
his hand above his head as he cheered, had given
his sprained ankle a new wrench, causing him to
nearly shriek aloud.</p>

<p>Frank was almost tempted to stop then and there;
but he knew that a sprain, while painful enough, was
not dangerous. And one of the fellows far in the
rear, who had no chance whatever to win the race,
would undoubtedly give poor old Bones a helping
hand to some nearby house where he could get a rig
to carry him home.</p>

<p>At the same time, upon hearing those significant
words uttered by the injured Columbia student, he
and Lanky exchanged looks.</p>

<p>It seemed almost impossible that even a tricky
fellow, such as Larry Parker appeared to be, could
manipulate things so that he might throw a competitor
out of the race in this remarkable way. And yet
if it were really an accident, then Frank would be
forced to believe that Parker must have been born
under a lucky star indeed.</p>

<p>“S’pose he did the trick, Frank?” asked Lanky,
showing that he too was wrestling over the possibility
of such a thing.</p>

<p>“Not unless he’d practiced it a hundred times,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
replied Frank. “But it shows you what might happen
when you’re trying to get ahead of Parker.
Look out for him, and give him a wide berth, Lanky,
when you pass him!”</p>

<p>“Huh! how about you?” grunted the other.</p>

<p>“Same here, if I get the chance,” was all Frank
said in reply.</p>

<p>Then they lapsed into utter silence again. Talking
might be all very well when out for a spin, just
to get exercise; but it is the height of folly when
pushing along at full speed in a race, with over five
miles still to be run.</p>

<p>They had picked up some on the leaders. Parker
and Coddling were not so very far ahead now. Most
of the time they could see the two boys, and were
thus able to gauge the distance separating them.
Lanky showed an inclination to cut down the gap
still more, and Frank had to humor him a little; for
he saw that his chum was able to make a burst of
speed that would overcome anything possible from
that pair in the van, when the right time arrived.</p>

<p>Now and then people along the road cheered them;
but none of these shouts gave the young Columbia
athletes one-half the inspiration that the agonized
cry of the injured Bones did, when he urged them
to leave him there, and hurry on to win the grand
race, for the honor of Columbia.</p>

<p>Now the five-mile mark had been turned, and they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
were once more circling, with the intention of heading
for home.</p>

<p>It was time, Lanky undoubtedly thought, that
something were done to oust those two persistent
runners from their hold of first and second place.
And as for Frank, he knew that the impetuous one
could not be much longer held in leash.</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>COLUMBIA’S LAST CHANCE</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> the run out they had been heading almost
due west, with the sun shining directly in their eyes.
Now that the turn had been made, they had it easier;
for they were no longer half blinded by that glare.</p>

<p>The railroad was not so very far off but that a
train passing at one place, the passengers leaned out
of the windows waving hankerchiefs, and shouting
words of cheer. For everybody loves a boy athlete,
and seems to be drawn to utter strangers, when
coming upon them unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Frank had already made up his mind on several
matters. One was that he did not feel his best somehow,
on this important day; and that if it all depended
on him, there was a strong possibility that
either Clifford or Bellport would land the prize,
and carry off that gold watch.</p>

<p>This might have worried him considerably at another
time, but it did not now; for he had been keeping
a watchful eye on his running mate, and realized<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
that Lanky was in fit shape for the greatest effort
of his life.</p>

<p>Barring accidents, Frank really believed the long-legged
fellow could overtake the leaders inside of
a quarter of a mile, no matter how desperately they
strove to maintain their present advantage.</p>

<p>He was content that it should be so. And in times
to come he would never envy Lanky that splendid
timepiece, which was to be the reward of his pluck
and running ability.</p>

<p>Still, he deemed it wise to hold back as much as
he could, and not allow this impetuous comrade his
head. Letting the two who led the run set the
pace, was the wisest thing that could be done. They
were apt to vie with each other in little spurts that
were calculated to exhaust their vim; while those
behind could continue to push steadily along in a
grinding, irresistible way, always keeping a certain
amount of reserve speed on tap for an emergency.</p>

<p>It was about this time that the runners entered
upon the gloomiest part of the entire course. Frank
remembered the stretch of dense woods full well.
He had even hunted for gray squirrels here, more
than a few times; though as a rule the boys of Columbia
seldom came this way, when the river offered
them such a field for most of their sports, summer
and winter.</p>

<p>The trees were of unusual size, and grew so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
thickly that there was always an aspect of gloom
hanging over the district. It had rather a bad name,
too, on account of a peddler having met with his
death here years back; and though the authorities
had done their duty as well as possible, the tramp
who undoubtedly was responsible for the forest
tragedy had never been apprehended.</p>

<p>Still, there did not seem to be any chance for even
a schemer such as Frank believed Larry Parker to
be to play any trick upon his opponents. He could
not slacken his own pace; and it was altogether unlikely
that he would influence any Clifford comrade
to lie in wait, so as to trip the runners, or in
some other way bring them to a stop.</p>

<p>Besides, just then Parker was in the lead, and
could not know what a surprise was in store for him
when Lanky Wallace broke loose. He seemed to
have only the wily Bellport runner, Coddling, to
fear. And that fellow was too smart, Frank believed,
to give his rival any chance to come in contact
with him.</p>

<p>Four miles more to run!</p>

<p>How slowly time seemed to pass! Why, it was as
though an age had elapsed since the pistol cracked
that sent the contestants flying like the wind on their
way.</p>

<p>“Can’t we go a <i>little</i> faster, Frank?” Lanky asked,
as they struck the big woods; and the look he turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
on his chum was more expressive than even his
words.</p>

<p>Frank shook his head in the negative. Knowing
the impulsive nature of the tall Columbia student,
Roderick Seymour in the beginning had given Lanky
to understand that he must govern his actions by
those of Frank Allen. If the other gave him the
word to let himself out at any time, then he could
start on his own responsibility. For it was understood
before the race started, that the contestants
of each school could assist one another by advice,
or in any other legitimate way, while endeavoring
to land the prize.</p>

<p>A minute later Lanky suddenly cried out; and it
gave Frank a shock, for he instantly conceived the
thought that his running mate must have wrenched
an ankle, and that would put him out of the running.</p>

<p>“What is it?” he gasped.</p>

<p>“Look ahead, at the side of the road!” answered
the other, between his set teeth.</p>

<p>Frank did so, and immediately echoed Lanky’s
cry.</p>

<p>“Another fellow put out of the race, just like
Bones was!” he exclaimed, feeling that this time it
certainly could not have been an accident that had
disabled the second rival of Larry Parker.</p>

<p>But the sharp eyes of Lanky had made an additional
discovery. It was not any too bright there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
under those great trees; but Lanky was noted for
his keen eyesight.</p>

<p>“It isn’t Coddling at all!” he called out, as he ran
on.</p>

<p>“That’s a fact; because he’s dressed in regular
clothes; but it’s a boy, and he acts like he was suffering
like anything!” Frank went on, slackening
his pace just a little as they drew nearer the recumbent
figure.</p>

<p>Just then the boy who had been lying there like
one nearly dead, heard the sound of their voices,
likely enough; at any rate, he lifted his head, and
seeing them, made a desperate effort to scramble
to his feet.</p>

<p>The first thing Frank saw was that one of his
legs seemed utterly helpless. Then he felt a thrill
of horror, for he discovered that blood was trickling
down, as though the wound might be most severe.</p>

<p>“Wow! it’s Bill Klemm!” burst from Lanky, who
had been staring at the pained face of the boy.</p>

<p>The fellow immediately stretched out both hands
toward the runners, and called to them in a weak
voice that quite wrung Frank’s heart.</p>

<p>“Fellers, get help fur me, quick! I’ve nigh bled
to death. Fell out of a high tree, and broke my
leg, I ’spect. Oh! the bone come through, and it
keeps on bleedin’ to beat the band! Please don’t
leave me like them other fellers did. I’ll die, sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
I will. Oh! it’s terrible, the pain! Frank, Lanky,
help me!”</p>

<p>The two long-distance runners stopped short. The
lure of that golden prize was for the moment utterly
forgotten by both of them. Here was a boy whom
they had never liked, and who was known as the
latest scapegrace of the town. Even then he was
hiding from justice, fearing punishment because of
that fire at the high-school building, which was laid
at his door.</p>

<p>But for all that he was one of their schoolmates.
They had played with him from time to time in the
past. And there could be no doubt in the world but
that poor Bill Klemm was suffering dreadfully; there
was no make-believe about that expression of pain
on his dirty face.</p>

<p>“We must help him, Frank!” said Lanky, firmly.</p>

<p>He wanted to win that race above all things.
Glory and victory, together with that fine prize, had
been ever before his mind. Then there was his
promise to Dora that he would do his very level
best to bring the Columbia colors in ahead of all
competitors.</p>

<p>But above all else Lanky had a heart. He could
not pass by, as evidently Parker and Coddling had
done, without extending even a word of sympathy
to the stricken bad boy of Columbia.</p>

<p>Frank had to do some pretty tall thinking just<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
then. He would not desert Bill, but was there any
necessity for both of them to give up the run?</p>

<p>He could hardly believe that Coddling, at any
rate, would have been quite so cold-hearted. Perhaps
he had not understood what it really meant.
He may even have suspected that some wily Columbia
student, hoping to delay the leaders, had
gotten himself up in this fashion to play the injured
act. All sorts of expedients had been practiced
in former long runs, to break in upon the winning
spell of the leaders; and clever Coddling was
alive to such tricks.</p>

<p>But with Frank and Lanky there could be no
such excuse for wantonly deserting the boy who
begged for their help. They could see for themselves
that he was in a serious condition; and that
unless someone stood by him, to assist in stopping
that flow of blood, Bill might even die.</p>

<p>Frank knew that his work was cut out for him.
He did not relinquish the last hope of being in the
run to the finish without a sigh; for there was always
some expectation that Columbia might have
to look to him for victory, should Lanky fail in the
pinch.</p>

<p>But he sturdily put the clamps on when he felt
this spirit trying to choke the generous impulses of
his heart.</p>

</figure>


<p>Lanky must go on, and do his level best for Old<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
Columbia; leaving to him the less pleasant duty
of caring for the injured Bill Klemm.</p>

<p>“I’ll look after him, Lanky; you keep right along,
and beat them out! Hear?” he exclaimed, turning
on his chum.</p>

<p>Lanky shook his head in the negative.</p>

<p>“You go, and let me stay, Frank!” he said, crushing
down the feeling of rebellion because so miserable
a specimen as Bill Klemm, of all Columbia
boys, should interfere with the successful carrying-out
of their part in the race.</p>

<p>“I’ll not stir from this spot until I’ve seen Bill
taken in charge,” was the way Frank spoke. “And
it’s silly to think that both of us must stay. There
will be others along after a minute or two, and they
can help me. Go on, I tell you, Lanky. You <i>must</i>
win this race. Think of Dora; and the proud colors
of Columbia that will be trailed in the dust if you
fail them. My duty is here; yours to beat out those
two runners ahead. Now you’re off!”</p>

<p>Frank actually turned Lanky around, and gave
him a shove. The tall boy glared once over his
shoulder, and gave his chum a last look, in which
affection mingled with the stern resolve that filled
his soul.</p>

<p>Then he was away like the wind. Around the
bend beyond he flashed as might a departing sunbeam;
and Frank Allen, as he turned once more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
toward the injured boy, was saying gladly to himself:</p>

<p>“Lanky will do it! he’s keyed up to making a
record run; and he’ll just pass the other fellows
like they were standing still!”</p>

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIII<br>

<small>THE END OF THE LONG RUN</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Where</span> are Asa Barnes and Wat Kline?”</p>

<p>Frank asked the question as he was bending down
over the wounded boy, making a rude tourniquet,
with which to stop the flow of blood, by compressing
the leg above the broken part.</p>

<p>He put this question from a double motive; being
curious to know why Bill’s cronies had not attempted
to assist him in his trouble; and also to keep the mind
of the wounded boy off his pain as much as he could.</p>

<p>“The skunks deserted me at the last!” grumbled
Bill, gasping with the agony he was doubtless enduring.</p>

<p>“Do you mean they ran away, and left you like
this?” demanded the amateur surgeon, twisting the
stick he had inserted in the handkerchief that was
already knotted around the leg.</p>

<p>“Naw, they never knowed anything about me
bein’ hurt,” whimpered Bill, and then he gave a
little snort, going on: “Ouch! that hurts like all get<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
out, Frank! Let up on a feller a little, can’t you?
I know I ain’t always treated you white; but sure
you wouldn’t take it out on me, now I’m down!”</p>

<p>“You don’t understand, Bill,” Frank replied, giving
even a firmer twist to the handkerchief by means
of the grip he maintained on the stick which was
passed through the upper part; “I’m trying to press
down on the artery, and stop the flow of blood. It
may hurt some; but be a man and bear it. I’m doing
all I can to save your very life, Bill.”</p>

<p>The wretched Bill began to cry, and Frank hardly
knew what he could do, since he had his hands full
with holding that knotted handkerchief, and the stick
with which he had turned it again and again, until
the knot pressed down exactly on the artery under
the knee, and stopped the blood from flowing.</p>

<p>Just then a runner came along. It was Wentworth,
of course. And he gave signs of meaning
to stop to ask what it all meant.</p>

<p>Frank knew that possibly this runner might have
a ghost of a show to come in either first, or second.
Those further back would be out of the running
by the time they arrived here; and he could depend
on one of them to assist him.</p>

<p>So he waved his hand to Wentworth, and called
out:</p>

<p>“Go on! Don’t stop for a second, Wentworth!
You’ve still got some show! One of our Columbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
boys here has been hurt. I’ll stop Mallory or Keating
when they come on, to help me get him out of
this before he bleeds to death. Get along with you
now, Wentworth. Take the will for the deed! Your
school wants you to make a try for that prize!”</p>

<p>Thus urged, Wentworth did push right along,
though be it said to his honor that he gave evidences
of reluctance in so leaving Frank. He must have
seen from the appearance of the wounded boy that
it was a serious matter.</p>

<p>“Oh! why did you let him go on?” complained
Bill, who was getting a trifle light-headed, the result
of the pain and excitement combined. “Looks
like you just wanted me to die right here, Frank
Allen.”</p>

<p>“There are two other fellows coming along soon,
and they’ll stop to help us,” Frank tried to console
him by saying. “Yes, I can see one right now, and
he’ll sure be here in a minute, Bill. Just keep up
your pluck a little while more. It’s going to be all
right; and you’ll pull through, never fear.”</p>

<p>But poor Bill was almost in a state of collapse
by the time Mallory reached the spot. Frank did not
know this boy, for he was a newcomer in Bellport.
But he had a good face; and sure enough, as soon
as he understood what the matter was, he evinced
a perfect readiness to stand by.</p>

<p>“My chance for making that prize has gone anyway,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Allen,” he said, with a sigh of keen disappointment.
“I worked too hard the last week, and
you can see I’ve just gone stale. Can’t get any
speed out of my legs, no matter how I try. So I
call quits right here, and stay with you to help get
this poor chap to a doctor.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, yes, that’s what I need, boys!” muttered
Bill, weakly.</p>

<p>“Here comes Keating along,” Mallory continued
presently; “and he’s pretty well winded, too; so I
reckon he’ll hold over, and give us a hand. That’s
better than coming in at the tail-end of the procession,
anyhow. People’ll say you might ’a’ had
a <i>little</i> chance, only that duty held you on the road.
Hi! Keating, we want you here!”</p>

<p>The runner was not averse to stopping, for his
wind seemed about gone. Indeed, he was even then
possibly debating whether he wanted to keep up the
hopeless race, or head for Bellport on a walk, to
strike the trolley line further down the road.</p>

<p>“What’s all this mean?” he asked, in a gasp, as
he came up.</p>

<p>“A fellow has been badly hurt, and we’ve got to
get him to town,” Mallory explained.</p>

<p>“If one of you could keep hold of this stick, and
not let up on the pressure a little bit, I’d try and find
a farm somewhere near, where I could borrow a
horse and wagon, to carry him back to town,” Frank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
remarked just then, knowing that it was their only
chance.</p>

<p>“Sure, we’ll stick by you, Allen!” was the ready
response of Keating, who proved to be a pretty fine
sort of a fellow. “Skip out, and get back as soon
as you can. I’d like to pike on to the grounds, and
see who won the race before all the crowd gets
away. But we’ll wait, no matter how long you take,
Allen.”</p>

<p>“Oh! rats! what have we got to lose?” replied the
other, laughingly. “We’re long since out of the
swim, anyhow. But I say, Allen, where’d you learn
how to put on a tourniquet so well? My dad’s the
new doctor in Bellport, and I wager he’d say he
couldn’t have done it better himself, in an emergency.
If this fellow gets through alive, he’ll owe a
heap to you, believe me.”</p>

<p>But Frank did not wait to listen to any words
of praise. He was on the run even as Keating spoke
in this strain. For he had remembered that when
hunting squirrels in these woods, he had come
on a little farm that was almost lost among the tall
timber; and secured a most refreshing drink of
buttermilk from a pleasant woman who seemed to
be running the place.</p>

<p>It was to look for this that he now set out. And
he was cudgeling his brains as hard as he could
while hastening away, trying to figure out just how<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
he could best reach this hidden farm. A mistake
might lose him much time; and if the life of the
wounded boy was to be saved, they must surely get
him to the doctor as speedily as possible.</p>

<p>Fortunately Frank was a boy who noticed everything;
and once he had visited a place, he could find
his way there again because of this habit of observation.
So now he called things to mind, and remembered
how he had passed that crooked tree that
made him laugh because of its queer shape, just after
he came out of the lane that led direct to the hidden
farm.</p>

<p>And so he found what he sought, and turning in,
sped lightly along, rapidly nearing the farm. The
only thing that worried him now was the possibility
of the occupants being away; for nearly everybody
around Columbia for twenty miles had in some way
heard of the great athletic contests, and doubtless
made it a point to be present on this eventful day.</p>

<p>If that happened to be the case, and he could find
a spare horse, as well as any sort of vehicle, Frank
was resolved to appropriate them without any
compunction. When a human life depends on rapid
action, it is no time to stand on ceremony; and
he felt sure he could depend on that cheery little
woman of the farm to applaud his action.</p>

<p>Sure enough, there was no one home at that hour.
Chickens were in evidence; a litter of pigs grunted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>
near the barn; several sheep were cropping the grass
in a nearby pasture; just beyond a group of gentle-eyed
cows looked curiously at him as he came hastily
up, and called out.</p>

<p>But the house was closed, and the door locked!</p>

<p>Frank ran straight out to the barn and stables.
Here he found an old horse, and a wagon that would
serve his purpose. Managing to hitch the animal
between the shafts after some fashion, Frank threw
armfuls of sweet smelling hay into the bed of the
vehicle, upon which the wounded boy could lie.</p>

<p>Then he was off, using the whip on the old animal
in a fashion that doubtless astonished Dobbin not a
little. But the beast kicked up his heels, and went
on a gallop down the lane until the road was
reached.</p>

<p>So, before a great while had elapsed, Frank was
back again with the boys who were bending over
poor Bill, dressed only in their running togs as
they were. With as much tenderness as possible
they lifted the wounded lad, and deposited him in
the wagon. He cried out with the agony several
times, though they tried to be very careful.</p>

<p>Frank drove the old horse, while the other two
sat alongside Bill, and endeavored to cheer him up;
though the boy began to close his eyes, and seemed
as though he might be faint with what he had gone
through.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>While the road was good Frank hurried the
animal as much as he dared. And since they must
pass the athletic grounds on their way to Columbia,
he would not have been human had he not listened,
with his heart seemingly in his mouth, to catch the
tenor of the exultant shouts that were being raised
by the departing hosts of spectators.</p>

<p>They were streaming in various directions, in
knots and crowds, and the greatest enthusiasm
seemed to abound; as though the finish of the long
run might have been very dramatic.</p>

<p>Borne on the late afternoon breeze came the familiar
chorus of voices that the efficient cheer captain,
Herman Hooker, led with such powerful effect.</p>

<p>The sound thrilled Frank Allen as nothing else
could have done. He found himself involuntarily
joining in with that never-to-be-forgotten rallying
cry that had so often aroused himself and his mates
to undreamed-of endeavors on the field of strife:</p>

<p>“Ho! ho! ho! hi! hi! hi! <i>veni! vidi! vici!</i> We
came, we saw, we conquered! Columbia! ’Rah!”</p>

<p>That told the story! The departing hosts seemed
to be all Columbia people, judging from the shouts
that arose. Then Lanky—good, reliable old Lanky—had
passed both Parker and Coddling in the race,
and landed the colors of his school across the tape,
winner of the long run!</p>

<p>And Frank felt content that it was so.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXIV<br>

<small>WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Oh! Frank!</span>”</p>

<p>There was Lanky, dressed in his everyday clothes,
and looking very unlike the proud victor of a long,
grueling run. But Frank could understand that his
chum was tremendously excited.</p>

<p>The three boys had just seen poor Bill taken into
his own home, with his mother crying over him,
and the father hastening to ’phone for a doctor to
come without delay; for they, like all other parents,
instantly forgave the erring son when they saw him
so terribly injured.</p>

<p>Frank had accepted the offer of Mallory that he
and Keating take the horse to a livery stable, and
they had just driven off, to communicate with the
owner later, when Lanky hailed in the manner stated
above.</p>

<p>“What’s up, Lanky?” asked Frank; “They tell
me you came in ahead, all right, and that Columbia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
will blaze with bonfires to-night because of your
great work.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right!” exclaimed Lanky, breathlessly;
“tell you all about it later. Get into your everyday
togs as fast as you can, and come with me.”</p>

<p>“Why, what’s the matter now?” demanded Frank;
though perhaps he began to have a dim suspicion
as to the cause of his chum’s new excitement.</p>

<p>“Had a message over the wire,” Lanky went on,
tersely, as though breath was more valuable now
than when on his long run; “little Effie had on
just such a bonnet when she disappeared. Mr. Elverson
and his wife were away, and just got my
wire. They’re coming along right now, and’ll get
here to-morrow, Frank.”</p>

<p>“Well, what are you going to do about it?” asked
Frank.</p>

<p>“Get the little girl before those gyps hike out,”
came the reply.</p>

<p>“Just us two go into that camp, where there are
something like five husky men, with faces I don’t
altogether like?” questioned Frank.</p>

<p>“Shucks! no. Don’t you understand, I’ve fixed
it up with Chief Hogg, and he’s to go along, with
two of his men. And more’n that, Frank, I’ve been
and got an order of arrest on the charge of kidnapping
for that old gypsy queen. Didn’t tell you about
that before, did I; eh? Well, I thought I’d spring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
a surprise, if the thing worked out right. Hit her
up now, and get dressed. I’ll go along and hurry
things.”</p>

<p>Frank was almost as excited now as Lanky had
been from the start. The great race had been won
by Columbia; and as if that were not enough glory
for one day, here they were about to prove that they
could play the part of detectives as well as win
juvenile Marathons.</p>

<p>Frank had to be urged to hasten no longer. He
ran like a greyhound for home, and to don an extra
suit of clothes, his ordinary wearing apparel being
down at the dressing-rooms of the athletic grounds,
where he could get it on the next day.</p>

<p>The way Frank got into those clothes would
have opened the eyes of some boys, who, having no
bump of order, can never find anything that belongs
to them. And as soon as he had finished, he
found that Lanky had already made a break for
the outer air.</p>

<p>“We’ve got to get a wagon at the livery!” was
what the leader called back over his shoulder; and
about three minutes later a couple of panting boys
were demanding that a vehicle capable of holding
half dozen at least be hitched up.</p>

<p>After that came the job of getting the co-operation
of the police. Luckily Chief Hogg had arrived
home from his duties of repressing the smaller boys<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
at the athletic grounds. And not being averse to
figuring in a matter that was apt to get his name
printed in the big daily papers of the metropolis,
he at once hustled a couple of his men around to
the big wagon.</p>

<p>Frank saw that they were, as he expressed it,
“loaded for bear”; since every man swung a club;
and moreover made it a point to have a suspicious
bulge under the tails of his coat, showing that he
carried a big revolver in a hip pocket.</p>

<p>The Chief himself drove the horses attached to
the wagon. Doubtless people, seeing them pass,
might wonder what was going on; but then that day
had been so filled with thrills that they could not
bother themselves any great length of time in useless
speculation.</p>

<p>“Now tell me something about how you came in,”
demanded Frank, after they were well started on
the little run to Budd’s Corners.</p>

<p>“Oh; on the jump, sure!” replied Lanky, with
one of his usual laughs.</p>

<p>“But go on and tell me about it,” Frank persisted.
“You must have overhauled the two runners ahead
of you before a couple of miles had been laid away.
How was it when you went ahead? Did anything
happen? Was there anything said, or attempted,
about that time, Lanky?”</p>

<p>“I passed Coddling first of all,” the other remarked.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
“I think he made some sort of sarcastic
remark; but then that was only what you’d expect.”</p>

<p>“And Parker?” persisted Frank.</p>

<p>“He looked back just then,” Lanky remarked.
“P’raps he heard Coddling call out; but all I know
is he turned his head and saw me. And Frank, he
looked like he was too mad for anything. I knew
he wouldn’t let me pass him if he could help it.
And I just remembered all you’d said about what
I must do.”</p>

<p>“Yes, go on, Lanky,” urged Frank; while even
the police officers listened with apparent interest as
the boy told his story of how the long run was made.</p>

<p>“I kept getting closer and closer to Parker,”
Lanky continued. “He was doing all he knew how
just then to hold his own; but, Frank, I was feeling
that frisky I reckon I c’d ’a’ drawn circles around
that dub if I tried.”</p>

<p>“But you didn’t go to all that trouble, Lanky?”
remarked Frank, laughing at the way the other
put it.</p>

<p>“When I was just back of him I kept my eyes
open for any of his little tricks,” the tall boy explained.
“You see, I didn’t want to get hit by any
stone that might just take a notion to fly up from
his feet, and get in my way, like poor old Bones.
And I was watchin’ for a chance to flip past Parker
when he didn’t expect it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>“Which I take it you did after a little?” Frank
suggested, to hurry Lanky on; for they were even
then drawing near the camp of the Romany tribe.</p>

<p>“Yes, I saw him make a movement of some sort;
and thinkin’ he was goin’ to drop something in front
of me, I just skipped across to the other side of the
road in great shape, and then lit out for all I was
worth. Heard him tryin’ to say somethin’ or other,
but he was too late; because, you see, I was ahead.
And after that I could give Larry the grand laugh.
I just romped in, with him fifty yards behind, and
Coddling picking up on him fast; because, you see,
the wonder was played out. That’s all. I tried to
duck when the boys made a grab for me; but they
insisted on carryin’ me around the field on their
shoulders, while they roared our school song. And
there’s the camp, Frank!”</p>

<p>“I’m going to look at your watch later on, Lanky;
but it sure gives me great pleasure to see you wearing
it,” Frank remarked.</p>

<p>“It might have been yours, if you hadn’t made me
go on, and leave you with Bill,” grumbled the unselfish
tall chum.</p>

<p>“Oh! no, that’s where you’re away off, Lanky,”
came the reply. “I knew that you were the only
one who could head that Parker with the lead he
had. But now let’s hope the same sort of success
falls to us here as came in that long run.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>The gypsy camp looked rather quiet. Frank was
glad to see no men in evidence, and could give a
pretty good guess that they were all off, occupied
with driving hard and fast bargains in horse trading
with the many farmers in town for that day.</p>

<p>This pleased Frank, because if the gypsy men
were absent it diminished the chances of a riot
all the more, should Chief Hogg carry off the old
queen. He expected to do this on the strength of
the warrant Lanky had sworn out, charging her
with abducting a child belonging to Mr. and Mrs.
Elverson of a neighboring State.</p>

<p>When the wagon had arrived close to the camp
those aboard jumped down, much to the surprise
and consternation of several dark-faced women and
children, who had run out to see the police wagon
pass by.</p>

<p>“Which is her wagon, Lanky?” demanded the
Chief, hurriedly.</p>

<p>“That biggest one, with all the gold paint, and
pictures on the panels, over yonder,” replied the
boy, pointing.</p>

<p>“This way, men, and surround that van! Be
sure you let not a single person escape from it!”
called the Chief, holding his long night-stick out
in a threatening manner, as he led the charge
through the camp; where kettles were kicked to one
side, piles of bright-hued cushions leaped over, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>
a few dogs frightened off by the hostile demeanor of
the men in blue uniforms.</p>

<p>In this manner, therefore, did the valorous Chief
Hogg, and his several equally brave men, manage
to reach the big van, which they speedily surrounded.
The boys only hoped that no warning of their coming
might have been conveyed to the queen; and
that she would be caught inside, together with the
child whom they had from the beginning been trying
to rescue from bondage and tyranny.</p>

<p>In making this movement the head of the local
force had been careful to take up a position himself
that gave him command of the door in the
rear of the traveling wagon. He looked about him
as if to make sure that everything was arranged,
and his men in their proper positions. Then he
turned to Lanky.</p>

<p>“The warrant, if you please, Lanky!” he said in
his heavy voice.</p>

<p>Lanky only too willingly surrendered the precious
document which called upon the officers to bring
the persons of the gypsy queen, and the small child
which would be found in her care, before the nearest
magistrate, and charging her with having kidnapped
the little girl, for some purpose unknown to the
court.</p>

<p>Then the pompous Chief knocked upon the closed
door of the van. It was immediately opened, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[223]</span>
the astonished face of the old queen became visible.
She looked at the men in their uniforms and then at
the two boys. Evidently the sight of Lanky excited
her anger, just as a red flag will that of a
bull. She shook her fist at him, and burst out in
a flow of furious words:</p>

<p>“You are to blame for this! I knew you were
not coming here to our camp, and prowling around,
without some reason. Now, what does all this mean,
and what has the queen of the gypsies done that she
should be disturbed in her home by the officers of
the house-dweller’s law? By what right are you
here? Speak up, you fat man with the silver badge
on your breast, and tell me of what crime Queen
Esther is accused!”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXV<br>

<small>THE STOLEN CHILD</small></h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">With</span> her eyes sparkling with rage the old queen
looked very ferocious. But Chief Hogg did not
quail. It would be a pretty thing to tell if he had
shown the white feather in the face of a woman,
no matter if she was a swarthy gypsy queen.</p>

<p>“I have here,” he went on to say, pompously,
never noticing the slur in her language when she
addressed him; “a legally sworn warrant, charging
you with having in your wagon a small child—yes,
a girl at that—which it is claimed you have abducted,
kidnapped, carried away from its proper parents
or guardians. And by virtue of my office, and this
document, I am directed by the justice to bring both
woman and child before him at once. So produce
the child, and prepare to accompany us back to
town.”</p>

<p>He made a motion, and his men closed in. The
old queen looked as though she might defy the
authorities of Columbia; but a glance around showed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
that not a single one of her men was within call.
So she knew she must give up.</p>

<p>“I have a child, I confess,” she said, scornfully,
addressing Frank rather than the big policeman;
“and it does not belong to my tribe, but I expected
to adopt it after a while, if no one claimed it. A
woman came to us several months ago, when, we
were camped far away from here. She seemed to
be out of her mind, and we took her in. The little
girl was with her. She died soon afterwards, and
the child was left with us. All this can be proved.
What have I to fear?”</p>

<p>Turning, she spoke to someone behind her, when
the girl the boys had seen before, and whom the
queen had called her granddaughter, Mena, shoved
forward. She, too, looked scornfully at the big
policeman, and undoubtedly the defiant nature of
the old queen had descended to the child.</p>

<p>She was leading a small girl, whose hair seemed
to be black enough, and her skin as dusky as that of
the genuine gypsy, but whose eyes were a bonny
blue.</p>

<p>She looked eagerly at the boys, and seeing Lanky,
held out her hands toward him.</p>

<p>“What is your name, little girl?” Lanky asked,
ready to give a shout, so filled with excitement did
he seem.</p>

<p>“Effie!” was the quick reply, in a childish voice,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
as the little one shrank from the old queen, who must
have been very cruel to her, Frank thought.</p>

<p>“That settles it!” yelled Lanky, as he turned on
Frank, the light of a second great victory in one
day filling his dancing eyes.</p>

<p>The Chief would take no delay. He realized that
should the gypsy men return and find him arresting
their queen, trouble of some sort was apt to ensue.
And while Chief Hogg could look very imposing
in his fine uniform, and possibly frighten boys, and
hungry hoboes, everyone knew he did not particularly
like a rough-and-tumble fight.</p>

<p>And so they all climbed up into the wagon, when
the return journey to town was begun. Fortunately
they happened to meet none of the gypsies on the
way. And the old queen seemed to be sure that she
could prove her statement, so that she would be
held guiltless. If anyone was guilty of abduction it
must have been the half-crazed woman who came
with the child. And she had long since passed to
a land where human laws could never reach her.</p>

<p>It turned out just as the gypsy queen had said.
She had been wise enough long before to write an
account of the happening, and have it published in
some little country paper, that, having no circulation
outside of the village where it was printed,
was never seen by those who searched far and wide<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>
for traces of the long-lost daughter of the rich
Elversons.</p>

<p>And when she produced a copy of this it
was seen that she could not be held on any charge,
unless that of cruelty toward the child. But she
had been smart enough never to whip the little girl
in a manner that would leave any traces; and so,
there being no witnesses, and a mere child’s word
not holding against that of the whole tribe, she was
finally allowed to go.</p>

<p>The tribe disappeared that same hour, nor did
they ever again come back to the vicinity of
Columbia.</p>

<p>On the day after the rescue of little Effie, her
parents arrived. Frank and Lanky met them at the
train. When they saw a beautiful, though sad-looking,
lady, accompanied by a tall gentleman, get off
the train, and look hungrily around, they waited
no longer, but rushed up to them.</p>

<p>“I’m the Lanky Wallace that sent the message,
Mr. Elverson!” cried the boy; and his happy face
caused the lady to cry:</p>

<p>“Oh! tell me, have you found her, my poor little
lamb?”</p>

<p>For answer Lanky just turned and gave a whistle
he had arranged with Effie, who had been left in
the station. And as the child came running toward
them, the lady started in amazement; for as yet nobody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
had been able to remove the stain that had been
used to color her hair and her whole body, so that
even her mother did not recognize her.</p>

<p>But when her childish voice piped up the one
word “mommy,” and the lady had a single look
into those laughing blue eyes, she doubted no longer,
but squeezed the little waif to her heart, laughing
and crying at the same time.</p>

<p>Of course they made a great ado over the two
boys, and Frank in vain tried to prove that it had
been all Lanky’s doings. His chum declared that
they were partners through it all; and that he would
never have been able to do the least thing toward
learning the truth if it had not been for the advice
and backing of Frank.</p>

<p>Later on they had to go over the whole story,
telling everything that had the slightest connection
with the gypsies and little Effie.</p>

<p>And before they went away with their recovered
darling, Mr. Elverson and his wife made the two
boys accept a most generous reward as a slight token
of their esteem.</p>

<p>“It is only what would have been paid to a
stranger who recovered our child for us,” the former
declared, “and which has long been standing as an
inducement for the detectives of the country to exert
themselves; but outside of that, my dear boys, we
can never forget what you have done. Our home<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
shall be open to you always, as though you were
kith and kin to us. And Effie will expect to see you
there as often as you can make it convenient.”</p>

<p>Of course the boys enjoyed all this. The story
had leaked out, and was told in every home in Columbia.
Chief Hogg seemed to have an added strut
to his walk; and it puzzled everyone to decide
whether this came from seeing his name mentioned
in the big New York dailies, as helping to recover
the long-lost child of the millionaire, Adolph Elverson;
or on account of the bulge in his pocket where
he kept his wallet, after Mr. Elverson had visited
him at headquarters.</p>

<p>Columbia High soon settled down to the duties
of the season, and that year Prof. Tyson Parke admitted
that the averages had never been so high.
He secretly gave it as his opinion that the encouragement
which clean athletics met with in his school,
backed by the far-seeing trustees, was the cause for
this increased interest shown by the pupils in their
studies.</p>

<p>Lanky was very proud of his gold watch. He
had to show it about twenty times a day for weeks
after the long run, and the victory won, had gained
him such a prize. And then his father, fearing that
it was making him vain, bought him a dollar nickel
timepiece, which he said was good enough for the
rough-and-tumble school life of a boy. The prize<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>
was put away; only to be worn on Sundays, and
special occasions; for it would do him when he
grew up.</p>

<p>During the vacation that now loomed up before
them, some of the boys who have figured extensively
in these stories were to decide whether they would
go to college, or, as Frank had suggested, take a
post-graduate course under Prof. Parke; since their
parents considered them rather young to break away
from all home ties, and face the many temptations
that beset the college student, especially in his freshman
year.</p>

<p>Bill Klemm recovered, though he was laid up for
two months. And there were many who echoed
what the good doctor told Bill and his parents, that
only for the first aid to the injured tactics of Frank
Allen, the boy would hardly have pulled through.
It doubtless would serve as a lesson to Bill, and
everybody hoped for the sake of his parents that
he would reform his ways.</p>

<p>If, as seems likely, Frank and a number of his
chums who reached the graduation class on the last
June school exhibition decide to stay in Columbia
High another year, we shall hope and expect to meet
them again amid scenes of boyish sports, where the
honor of the school is the magnet that leads the contestants
on to do their level best.</p>
